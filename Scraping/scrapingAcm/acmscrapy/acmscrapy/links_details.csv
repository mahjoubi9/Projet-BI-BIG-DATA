Research on the application of Blockchain Legal Technology in the supervision and management of online transactions,07 July 2022,"With the development of Internet technology, China's network trading activities are becoming increasingly popular, social e-commerce, live streaming with goods and other new formats and models continue to emerge, such formats in the main body of participation, business structure, transaction process and even information dissemination methods are different from the traditional network trading activities, stimulate the vitality of the new network trading market at one way , but also caused a large numbers of legal disputes. This paper briefly analyzes the logic and characteristics of online transaction mechanism and blockchain legal technology, and discusses the legal disputes between blockchain legal technology in solving data leakage, consumer rights protection, network fraud and division of departmental responsibilities in online transactions in the current market economy environment.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3532640.3532647,"Xiaoli Guo,Jian LI,JingWen Hang"
Research on Design and Application of Power Dispatch Based on Blockchain,20 July 2021,"With the large-scale access of renewable energy and the rapid development of electricity market operation, power dispatch urgently needs to improve the level of instant information sharing and service management capabilities. Through the blockchain technology, it can realize the credible sharing and traceability of key data, and further promote the efficiency of power dispatch collaboration management as well as the openness and transparency of the process of power dispatch. In this paper, the adaptability of blockchain and power dispatch business is analyzed, a power dispatch model with hierarchical management and hierarchical storage based on blockchain is proposed, and a fully functional dispatch blockchain platform is developed. Customized smart contracts are used to realize the automatic execution of the dispatch assessment and evaluation, and a consistency check mechanism is designed for the key data of the security and stability control device. Finally, two typical scenarios of dispatch management assessment and dispatch data management are selected for application research. The results show that the power dispatch model based on blockchain can significantly improve the transparency and operation efficiency of power dispatch, reduce the impact of the misoperation of the security and stability control device on the power grid, and promote the safe and stable operation of power grid.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460564,"Rizhen Qin,Lihua Zhao,Da Li,Ke Yang,Jiaxing Xuan,Hejian Wang"
Towards a Blockchain Deployment at UAE University: Performance Evaluation and Blockchain Taxonomy,15 March 2019,"Blockchain technology initially developed for transactions on cryptocurrencies is now gaining popularity in major domains such as education, healthcare, media, government, smart computing, and business enterprise. Blockchain manages the transactions database in a decentralized way replicated on all the nodes with no single governing authority. In this paper, we present a classification and taxonomy of different blockchain development platforms and simulators along with their consensus protocols, the types of supported blockchain networks and programming languages. We also assess the performance of a blockchain application for deployment at the UAE University (UAEU) versus increasing number of nodes, blocks and block size, on top of experimental network latencies and bandwidth between the nodes. Our results show that a large-scale deployment of blockchain at UAEU is feasible.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3320154.3320156,"Leila Ismail,Heba Hameed,Mahra AlShamsi,Manayer AlHammadi,Noura AlDhanhani"
A Blockchain Communication Resource Optimization Consensus Method,29 October 2022,"Since the emergence of Bitcoin, the blockchain technology behind it has been gradually gaining attention from all walks of life. As the core of blockchain technology, the consensus algorithm determines the security, scalability and decentralization of the blockchain and many other important characteristics. The efficiency of the current blockchain consensus algorithm still needs to be improved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a consensus algorithm for communication resource optimization (CCRO), which divides consensus nodes into different domains, calculates the trust of nodes by several trust factors, and assigns different roles to nodes according to the trust. It also introduces a new class of nodes, i.e., communication nodes, which are responsible for the delivery of messages in the consensus process, and achieves the communication resource optimization of the blockchain system. By building an experimental platform, we verify the performance of CCRO, which downscales the inter-node consensus communication protocol, optimizes the regional data synchronization protocol, reduces the network communication overhead, and effectively improves the consensus efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3559795.3559810,"Jingchang Yu,Tao Shen,Fenhua Bai,Zhuo Yu,Jianzhao Luo"
