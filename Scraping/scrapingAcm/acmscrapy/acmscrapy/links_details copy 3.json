{"title": "A Blockchain Communication Resource Optimization Consensus Method", "date": "29 October 2022", "abstract": "Since the emergence of Bitcoin, the blockchain technology behind it has been gradually gaining attention from all walks of life. As the core of blockchain technology, the consensus algorithm determines the security, scalability and decentralization of the blockchain and many other important characteristics. The efficiency of the current blockchain consensus algorithm still needs to be improved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a consensus algorithm for communication resource optimization (CCRO), which divides consensus nodes into different domains, calculates the trust of nodes by several trust factors, and assigns different roles to nodes according to the trust. It also introduces a new class of nodes, i.e., communication nodes, which are responsible for the delivery of messages in the consensus process, and achieves the communication resource optimization of the blockchain system. By building an experimental platform, we verify the performance of CCRO, which downscales the inter-node consensus communication protocol, optimizes the regional data synchronization protocol, reduces the network communication overhead, and effectively improves the consensus efficiency.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3559795.3559810", "Authors": ["Jingchang Yu", "Tao Shen", "Fenhua Bai", "Zhuo Yu", "Jianzhao Luo"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450396622", "nombredePage": "143  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, China", "Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, China", "Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, China", "Beijing Zhongdian Puhua Information Technology Co., Ltd, China", "Yunnan Key Laboratory of Blockchain Application Technology, China"], "Conference": "BIOTC 2022: 2022 4th Blockchain and Internet of Things Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3559795", "Total_Citations": "0"},

ITS has become more complicated and uncertain due to the existing security and privacy problems. Blockchain, being a decentralized and tamper-resistant technology, can provide an environment for ITS, allowing ITS entities to perform transactions securely and trustfully. However, the inefficiency problem of blockchain, severely restricts its development and application. Studies only combine traditional blockchain with ITS, but do not consider scaling blockchain to improve performance. This paper devotes to scale blockchain that adapted to ITS, improving the efficiency of the blockchain without sacrificing the decentralization and security. A sharding scheme is proposed, which takes network sharding, data sharding and state sharding into account. Nodes are divided into several shards. Different shards can process data in parallel and store related data in their own ledger. Backup shard is put forward in this paper to enhance the shard security. And network will reshuffle when one or more shards break down. Some experiments are performed using Hyperledger Fabric and network simulator 3. Throghput, storage and delay are tested under sharding scheme and non sharding solution. The results show that sharding method is effective in scaling blockchain for ITS.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3510487.3510506", "Authors": ["Yufei Liu", "Jiqiang Liu", "Jian Wang", "Tianhao Liu", "Xudong He"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387460", "nombredePage": "183  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, China", "Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, China", "Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, China", "Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, China", "Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"], "Conference": "ICBTA 2021: 2021 4th International Conference on Blockchain Technology and Applications", "doi": "10.1145/3510487", "Total_Citations": "0"},

We first provide a brief introduction of the blockchain technology, highlighting its design principle, nuts and bolts, and the most fundamental innovation of the technology. Next, we elaborate on a key concept regarding data immutability. In particular, it is a mistake to equate blockchain to data immutability. Data immutability can only be achieved in large-scale public blockchains where the cost becomes an insurmountable barrier for any attempt to change the data recorded in the blockchain. The third topic we discuss is the differences between public, private, and consortium blockchains. We caution the use of private and consortium blockchains.

Blockchain technology, with the characteristics of asymmetric encryption, decentralization, nonrepudiation, and conducting transactions without the supervision of a trusted third party, has revolved multiple stages of development. Smart contracts are regarded as an important derivative technology of blockchain, which are automatically executed by the code between multiple parties through the blockchain without relying on a trusted institution.

Thus, most blockchain technologies assume an environment with a fast and stable network. However, in some blockchain-based systems, e.g., supply chain management (SCM) systems, some Internet of Things (IoT) nodes can only rely on the low-quality network sometimes to achieve consensus. Thus, it is critical to understand the applicability of existing consensus algorithms in such environments. We performed a systematic mapping study to evaluate and compare existing consensus mechanisms\u2019 capability to provide integrity and security with varying network properties. Our study identified 25 state-of-the-art consensus algorithms from published and preprint literature. We categorized and compared the consensus algorithms qualitatively based on established performance and integrity metrics and well-known blockchain security issues.

Such consensus algorithms may also be vulnerable to distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) and routing attacks, given limited network throughput.

{"title": "Blockchain Adoption for Plea Bargaining of Corporate Crime in Indonesia", "date": "29 May 2020", "abstract": "The rise of corporate crime cases now shows that the handling has not found the right model, even though so far there has been a concept of legal settlement outside the court, otherwise known as plea bargaining. In addition to those who support, there are criticisms of the use of plea bargaining (such as too much discretion of prosecutors in plea bargaining, lack of legal substance that limits the possibility of abuse of authority by law enforcement officials, and the possibility of guilty plea not yet actual), but this criticism can be refuted through the use of blockchain technology in the mechanism of plea bargaining. In Indonesia, the regulation of the bargaining of corporate crime plea is still limited to the draft law. In fact, the draft is still not in accordance with the spirit of plea bargaining itself, such as the defendant whose plea bargaining application was received must still be tried through a short event examination, it does not regulate which types of criminal acts are categorized as special lines, bidding restrictions or negotiations between the defendant and the claimant general, and what form of waivers or rewards or concessions can be offered by public prosecutors. This shows the importance and urgency to build a transparent, efficient, fast and inexpensive plea bargaining model in Indonesia through the use of blockchain technology. In addition, the use of blockchain technology can provide adequate outputs and outcomes in dealing with corporate crime, because any data, information, complaints, and reports that are inputted based on each block will be automatically integrated into the fairness, legal certainty, and public benefit values as an independent and accountable decisionmaking tool for the authorities.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3390566.3391680", "Authors": ["Henry Dianto P.

A role playing simulation was used to evaluate the benefits provided by different levels of visibility in a typical supply chain. A distributed ledger enabling supply chain visibility was designed. A supply chain performance framework was developed in order to measure the supply chain performance from both lean and agile aspects. The results show a significant correlation in performance with the degree of visibility, but it is not a linear relationship. An effective LeAgile supply chain can be achieved with the enhancement of visibility. In order to implement visibility, an appropriate information sharing frequency (drumbeat) is needed. Blockchain allows users to more securely and transparently track all types of transactions, to improve Supply Chain Visibility. We also find the complex relationship between trust and visibility.

{"title": "Occupation mechanism for eliminating double-spending attacks on trusted transaction blockchain", "date": "20 July 2021", "abstract": "Using blockchain technology to build a trusted transaction foundation has become a hot topic of current research and practice. The double-spending phenomenon refers to the bifurcation of the blockchain structure. In the process of trusted transactions, the fork caused by malicious attacks will destroy the correctness, integrity, and consistency of the entire ledger, and causes serious economic losses to users. Therefore, eliminating double-spending attacks is an important issue to ensure the security of the blockchain. The current method of defending against double-spending attacks in trusted transactions mainly revolves around the Bitcoin blockchain system. In the process of researching the Nano blockchain grid project, a high-throughput trusted transaction system, we proposed a double-spending elimination solution for the system: the occupying mechanism. By using Java to reconstruct the Nano project and implement the occupying mechanism, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the occupying mechanism, and it is superior to the Nano project's double-spending solution based on the traditional voting mechanism in terms of time performance.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460543", "Authors": ["Yu-Yan Zhang", "Meng-Yan Huang", "Xu Zhang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450389624", "nombredePage": "216  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, P.

{"title": "A Hierarchical Blockchain-based Data Service Platform in MEC Environments", "date": "29 May 2020", "abstract": "Recently, data service companies analyzing IoT data to provide valuable knowledge emerge as a promising business model. To sustain such business model, the establishment of a data service platform for IoT data sharing and data service delivery becomes a necessity. Today, blockchain-based platforms are believed to be reliable but have poor system performance, considerable storage overheads and high energy consumption. MEC technology is then applied to help IoT devices participate in the blockchain network. However, the considerable loading of blockchain operations turns MEC hosts into a performance bottleneck, instead. Therefore, this paper exploits the hierarchical blockchain architecture in the proposed IoT data service platform, called HB-IoDS, to significantly reduce the storage overheads and service providing time. Furthermore, to alleviate the heavy burdens on MEC hosts, HB-IoDS provides the adaptive Proof-of-Work (APoW) consensus algorithm that derives an appropriate difficulty to achieve PoW condition according to device capability. By this mean, resource-constrained IoT devices can also perform blockchain operations which are usually regarded as energy-consuming. Finally, simulation results show that HB-IoDS outperforms existing blockchain-based platforms in terms of system performance, energy consumption, and storage costs. As a result, the proposed HB-IoDS is the most practical IoT data service platform.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3390566.3391674", "Authors": ["I-Hsun Chuang", "Shau-Hsien Chiang", "Wei-Chu Chao", "Shih-Hao Huang", "Bai-Lin Zeng", "Yau-Hwang Kuo"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377676", "nombredePage": "166  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"], "Conference": "ICBCT'20: Proceedings of the 2020 The 2nd International Conference on Blockchain Technology", "doi": "10.1145/3390566", "Total_Citations": "3"},

Therefore, an attacker may infer users' identities, behavior and preferences by analyzing the real-time power consumption, which is an immediate threat to the users' privacy. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme based on blockchain and group signature to protect the privacy of users' identities while enhancing the security of power systems. On one hand, smart meters serve as nodes in the blockchain system and ensure data consistency through consensus mechanism. On the other hand, as group members, smart meters make sure of the anonymity of end-users by generating group signatures for power data.

Blockchain is the underlining technology of Bitcoin. Blockchain technology has been used in many domains such as IoT, healthcare, education, business, Land management and so on. Among them Land Registration and Ownership Management is a very tough process all over the world. Land is a state immovable object and many frauds claim false ownership. It creates disputes among people. Also, many intermediaries are involved in this system. These intermediaries take huge amount of money to solve problems in time. For this reason, many people fail to achieve their own land. Blockchain technology has the all characteristics to solve these problems.

However, there are few publications on how PoS can be used to create new blocks in detail. The undisputed lead proponent for PoS is Ethereum. However, virtually all discussions regarding PoS for Ethereum are centered on selecting a block using PoS after one or more candidate blocks have already been somehow created. PeerCoin was the first blockchain system that incorporated PoS in block creation. Unfortunately, there is no known documentation on how PoS works in PeerCoin. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a detailed explanation of the PeerCoin PoS algorithm based on PeerCoin source code. We also dispel the misconception that PeerCoin PoS is based on Proof of Work (PoW) and hence would consume a lot of energy just like proof of work (PoW).

However, there still exist different scalability, security and potential privacy issues in blockchain networks, such as on-chain data privacy, data origin authentication, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving and user-controlled architecture for data sharing based on blockchain system and Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), called ThemisABE. The proposed scheme has properties including one-to-many data encrypting and fined-grained access control. In the ThemisABE, any party can be an authority and the algorithm of CP-ABE generates the secret key corresponding to attributes for data user through any chosen set of nodes in blockchain system. Moreover, in order to realize accountability of CP-ABE algorithm and avoid performance bottleneck incurred by smart contracts, a kind of data structure of transactions is designed to record in the ledger, following an approaches to off-chain computations. The results of security analysis and experimental simulation show that the proposed scheme can solves the problems of privacy security and localization of data sharing.

To scale up the blockchain services, a common approach is to employ a hybrid storage architecture, where only meta-data are stored on-chain and the raw data are outsourced to an off-chain storage service provider. In this scenario, users need to query the data on-chain and off-chain at the same time, and the key issue for query processing would be how to design a gas-efficient authenticated data structure (ADS) to guarantee the completeness and soundness. In this paper, we study the spatial keyword authentication queries in the hybrid-storage blockchain, which includes on-chain and off-chain storage.

In each round of the block generation, a node is selected as the creator of the next block by the verification, and the selected creator will pack appropriate transactions into the block and publish it on the blockchain. However, in the network with poor synchronization, the traditional PoS produces multiple verified representative nodes in each round, which generates multiple blocks. Then the blockchain is easy to produce the bifurcation. Aiming at the bifurcation problem of PoS, we propose an improved voting method based on credit rewards and punishments to vote on multiple blocks. The block is selected by considering the credibility of the creator, the count of the obtained comprehensive votes and the transaction value of the block.

{"title": "A Hierarchical Trust Management Architecture Based on Blockchain for Crossover Service", "date": "29 May 2020", "abstract": "As an emerging business model of the modern service industry (MSI), crossover service integrates services from enterprises and organizations in different fields. By combining computer and communication technologies, crossover service can improve the efficiency and quality of services. However, due to the complexity and heterogeneity among different industries, there still remain huge challenges regarding the service convergence process. One of the most important issues is the trust management in crossover services. The establishment of trust is the basic requirement of service convergence. In this paper, we first present the overview of crossover service and the issue of trust management by analyzing the specific application case of crossover service. Besides, based on blockchain technology, we will propose a decentralized trust management architecture to address the trust management issue in crossover service.

In this case, the electronic portfolio is designed as a promising tool for professionals and employers, in assessing and presenting guidance for further learning in the workplace environment. However, the implementation of electronic portfolios faces huge challenges, especially due to the lack of interoperability to collect and share competition evidence among multiple organizations and institutions. The growing trend of professional (learning) interoperability has brought other challenges that must be addressed in order to fully utilize the potential of the electronic product portfolio in the context of the fourth industry. This article proposes a framework taking the benefits of blockchain, decentralized storage systems, smart contracts and session management in achieving professional-centric interoperability while creating electronic portfolio and share evidences among multiple organizations without giving up the confidentiality, integrity and availability of shared evidence. The simulation of the proposed model for proof of concept on Ethereum proved its viability in real world practice.

Rather than issuing a token with both utility and financing attributes at the very beginning, a utility token with a warrant attribute is introduced to stimulate and facilitate the value exchange between miners and other participants.

Based on blockchain technology and SIFT local feature extraction algorithm, this paper studies and implements a new generation of image digital copyright system. SIFT algorithm is used to extract the invariant features of image such as angle of view, brightness and rotation, etc. which will constitute the local feature vector set of the image, and these local feature vector sets are regarded as the only copyright basis of the image. Even if the image is modified by scaling, rotation and brightness, local features can still be extracted correctly, which can effectively prevent copyright registration of infringing images; Furthermore, IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) was utilized for distributed storage of images' copyright features; Finally, Hyperledger Fabric and smart contract (chaincode) are used to realize copyright registration, copyright transfer and other functions.

Clients and service providers (SPs) exchange signed messages according to a predefined protocol that enables clients to utilize service-provider services with simultaneous cryptographic proof of service. When a client has discovered an SP to have violated a service level agreement based on cryptographic proof, then they can obtain cryptocurrency as a compensation by raising objections to a smart contract on a public blockchain. When an objection has been judged successful by programs located in the smart contract, a portion of the deposit (cryptocurrency in the smart contract) will be transferred to the account of the objection-raiser. In this way, the need to establish and run a customer service center with employees for processing such claims and refunds is obviated.

Nowadays, many transactions in the integrated circuit (IC) industry chain have moved from offline to online, most of which are completed through trusted third-party platforms as the transaction medium. This transaction model, which relies on centralized institutions, is vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks, poses a risk of core technology theft for technology-intensive industries, and lacks the ability to trace the trajectory of transactions. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a consortium chain-based transaction management system for the IC industry chain based on the transaction characteristics of commodities in the IC industry chain, designs an improved Raft consensus mechanism based on stability, credibility and contribution factors, a Prometheus-based data monitoring mechanism, and a set of smart contracts for on-chain transactions, implements a prototype system and tests its performance. The results show that the system can solve the above problems well and has high credibility and stability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460539", "Authors": ["Lei Pan", "Yue Wu", "Min Zhou", "Faxin Yu", "Zheming Lu", "Hua Chen"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450389624", "nombredePage": "216  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Zhejiang University, China", "Zhejiang University, China", "Zhejiang University, China", "Zhejiang University, China", "Zhejiang University, China", "Zhejiang University, China"], "Conference": "ICBCT '21: 2021 The 3rd International Conference on Blockchain Technology", "doi": "10.1145/3460537", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Against the backdrop of the global energy crisis, renewable energy has received great attention from countries around the world. Due to the characteristics of geographical dispersion, randomness, volatility and uncontrollability of renewable energy, the centralized traditional electrical energy networks cannot meet the management requirements of large-scale access to renewable energy. The emergence of the energy internet has enabled the effective use of renewable energy. As a distributed trading and data management technology, blockchain solves the problem of distributed electrical energy trading in the energy Internet. However, the distributed energy trading based on blockchain cannot satisfy the rational matching of trading objects. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based electrical energy trading system BC-TMS Blockchain-based trading matching system, which can reasonably match trading objects according to the user's personalized needs and maximize the benefits of both parties to the trading. At the same time, the system also provides a certain degree of privacy protection.

It is a distributed, decentralized, and public digital ledger technology. Blockchains have caught not only the attention of researchers but also industries that are interested in implementing blockchains into existing products and services. However, performing studies on actual blockchain networks remain challenging as they may involve many nodes or these nodes could be placed in different geographical regions. Simulators for Proof-of-Work blockchain exists to facilitate this, but features such as difficulty adjustment or dynamic hash rate are not available. Using SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator as a base, difficulty adjustment algorithm and the capacity to increase or decrease hash rate dynamically were added to the simulator and the efficacy of the implementation was investigated for two scenarios; fixed hash rate and increasing hash rate periodically, over the length of the simulations. Based on the experiments, higher precision in terms of the average of actual time taken to mine a block were obtained, with a deviation of 0.68% compared to 5.73% in original SimBlock, and a deviation of 7.10% compared to 10.91% in original SimBlock, for fixed hash rate and dynamic hash rate adjustment respectively. Further studies were conducted for data from 2019 where the proposed implementation resulted in less than half the deviation achieved by the original implementation of SimBlock.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3384943.3409437", "Authors": ["Zi Hau Chin", "Timothy Tzen Vun Yap", "Ian K.

We establish a certificate issuance verification mechanism to improve the data transmission security performance of the traceability system based on SM2 and SM3.

In addition, we also replaced the SM2 in the system with the RSA, and the SM3 with the MD5 to test the pros and cons of the two different algorithm systems in terms of security performance and execution efficiency. The test results show that the traceability mechanism based on SM2, SM3, and SM4 performs 1-2 seconds faster than the traceability mechanism based on RSA and MD5 in terms of average transaction response time.

In order to solve the disadvantages caused by centralization in traditional DRM, many decentralized DRM (DDRM) structure are proposed, and they have achieved decentralization in copyright registration, copyright trading, etc. However, the distribution of content keys is their bottleneck. Different from public copyright and transaction information, content key which is used for digital content decryption cannot be directly disclosed to decentralized nodes. The existing DDRM relies on specific nodes or an ideal trust environment to issue encrypted content keys, which makes the system unable to be completely decentralized. In this paper, we proposed a decentralized key distribution system, and it can be compatible with the existing DDRM structure. We use zero-knowledge proof technology to prove to others the correctness of the encrypted content key without revealing it. We use blockchain technology to achieve decentralized key distribution, without relying on any trusted center. Our system allows consumers and agents to apply for and distribute content keys without trusting each other.

Bitcoin, being one of the most widely used blockchain based transaction system, fails to provide enough protection on users' privacy. Many subsequent studies focus on establishing a system that hides the linkage between the identities (pseudonyms) of users and the transactions they carry out in order to provide a high level of anonymity. Examples include Zerocoin, Zerocash and so on. It thus becomes an interesting question whether such new transaction systems do provide enough protection on users' privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for de-anonymizing these transaction systems by leveraging information in the system that is not directly related, including the number of transactions made by each identity and time stamp of sending and receiving. Combining probability studies with optimization tools, we establish a model which allows us to determine, among all possible ways of linking between transactions and identities, the one that is most likely to be true. Subsequent transaction graph analysis could then be carried out, leading to the de-anonymization of the system. To solve the model, we provide exact algorithms based on mixed integer linear programming.

These features eliminate the quality of experience degradation caused by the spot price in the traditional dynamic pricing model on the QoE-aware service pricing. We also employ the payment channel in CloudArcade to improve the system performance. Discussions on service pricing criteria are put forward, open issues about token issuing and malicious resource speculation are also reviewed. We believe the design of CloudArcade can show a good generality on other QoE-aware and human-centered applications.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3384943.3409420", "Authors": ["Juntao Zhao", "Yuanfang Chi", "Zehua Wang", "Victor C.M.

{"title": "The Data Sharing Scheme based on Blockchain", "date": "06 October 2020", "abstract": "Data sharing is a vital method for data intensive and cooperative work-based applications. A central database system, which collects and stores data generated from different parties and provides open access, can not only save costs on infrastructures, but also provide consistent and uptodate data for all the participants. However, privacy and security issues also emerge especially when the shared data is highly sensitive, such as electronic medical records (EMRs). In this paper, we propose a new data sharing scheme with access control based on CP-ABE, searchable encryption, and blockchain. We realize two main goals in our scheme. First, data owners can share their data with multiple users who satisfy the access policy rather than just a single user. Second, the difficulty of the ciphertext query is overcome by means of searchable encryption technology. Most importantly, data owners do not need to interact with the data querier in the process of sharing. Both theoretical analysis and practical experiments show that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3384943.3409426", "Authors": ["Xu Ma", "Chen Wang", "Laihua Wang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450376105", "nombredePage": "223  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China", "Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China", "Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China"], "Conference": "BSCI '20: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Symposium on Blockchain and Secure Critical Infrastructure", "doi": "10.1145/3384943", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Once software execution transits into the pattern's entry state, off-chain execution continues until the execution transits into the pattern's exit state, when execution continues on-chain.

As the underlying infrastructure and protocol of blockchain, blockchain networks convey communications and coordination across all involving participants. In extensive application scenarios, conducting community detection over blockchain networks has potential effects on both discovering hidden information and enhancing communicating efficiency. However, the decentralised nature poses a restriction on community detection over blockchain networks. In coping with this restriction, we propose a distributed community detection method based on the Propose-Select-Adjust (PSA) framework that runs in an asynchronous way. We extend the PSA framework using the concept of structural entropy and aim to detect a community structure with low entropy. We test our entropy-based distributed community detection algorithm on both benchmark networks and bitcoin trust networks.

Due to opportunities such as data security, transparency, privacy and interoperability presented by decentralized applications on blockchain networks, organizations are now moving their inter-organizational functions to blockchain-based systems. Traditional system-design methods are not suitable for developing blockchain systems since they are not capable of capturing new functions that are associated with decentralized applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring existing design methods and frameworks that support the development of decentralized application on a blockchain. To achieve this, case-study based research is used in identifying current software-development techniques used in designing decentralized applications (DApp). Experts in this field are interviewed to identify their chosen techniques for designing and developing block-chain applications. Furthermore, related literature is selected to identify current techniques for DApp-designs based on the state of the art. A systematic analysis of the identified techniques is conducted using the current limitations of blockchain technology as criteria for the analyses.

Generally, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm is the wide-ly-used consensus algorithm in a consortium blockchain. However, this algorithm meets its bottleneck, when there are a large number of nodes in the consortium blockchain net-work. In order to enhance the scalability of the consensus algorithm, this paper puts for-ward an advanced PBFT-based consensus algorithm, named ANPBFT, by taking ad-vantages of the message aggregation technology and tree topology technology. Specially, the consensus nodes in our proposed algorithm are divided into active nodes and passive nodes. Then, the consensus of block information is equivalent to the confirmation of iden-tity aggregation signature and aggregation promise of information key.

The peer-to-peer distributed ledger platform connects organizations and car owners with disparate interests and hidden intentions. While previous literature has chiefly examined incentives for permissionless platforms, we leverage studies about crowdsensing applications to stimulate research on incentives in permissioned blockchains. This article uses the action design research approach to create an incentive system featuring a rating mechanism influenced by data correction measures. Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms.

Rational miners aim to maximise the profit generated by the mining activity, and thus choose the transactions offering the highest fee per byte for their consolidation. In this paper, we propose a queueing model to study the relation between the fee offered by a transaction and its expected consolidation time, i.e., the time required to be added to the blockchain by the miners. The solution of the queueing model, although approximate, is computationally and numerically efficient and software systems can use it online to analyse the trade-off between costs and response times. Indeed, a static configuration of the model would not account for the high variations in the blockchain workload and fees offered by other users.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3427921.3450249", "Authors": ["Simonetta Balsamo", "Andrea Marin", "Isi Mitrani", "Nicola Rebagliati"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450381949", "nombredePage": "301  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari Venezia Venice, Italy", "Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari Venezia, Venice, Italy", "University of Newcastle, Newcastle, United Kingdom", "Blockchain Analyst, Lucca, Italy"], "Conference": "ICPE '21: Proceedings of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering", "doi": "10.1145/3427921", "Total_Citations": "3"},

This paper is the first to discuss these solutions and their usage and benefits. However, there is not yet any solution in the literature that issues or validates a certificate which includes courses from different educational institutes. This paper proposes a novel framework for cross-education blockchain-based solution. It collects participating institutes in one blockchain network. Graduates of this solution can join courses in the institutes that provide the latest and strongest contents. The issued certificate is self-validating for all the courses that are obtained from multiple institutes. It is cryptographically coded and securely stored using the blockchain technology. It can be validated instantaneously through one validation portal independently without contacting its issuing institutes. The saved time and resources are oriented toward enhancing students' services.

It demonstrates that the 2PC blocking can be eliminated at a moderate financial cost, if the blockchain also meets the synchrony requirements.

IOT system using centralized server mode face great security challenges. Blockchain, based on distributed ledger technology, could be a good solution. In order to combine blockchain technology and IOT applications appropriately, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain with low communication overhead (LBLCO). A new consensus algorithm named proof of repute score based on hidden block (HBPORS) is proposed in LBLCO. The nodes with higher repute score will be more likely to become winner in HBPORS. The repute score mechanism dynamically update the repute score of the nodes according to the contribution and evil behavior of the node in the blockchain system. When the honest node with high repute score obtains the accounting right, it can trigger the hidden block mechanism. Instead of broadcasting the complete information of the packaged block to all nodes, winners can broadcast the low overhead information to other nodes. Through experimental tests, LBLCO can meet the requirements of large number of nodes and fast response speed in the IOT.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3559795.3559808", "Authors": ["Chao Chen", "Mingzhe Liu", "Peijun Mo", "Cuixu Yuan", "Pengyu Dai"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450396622", "nombredePage": "143  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Chengdu University of Technology, China", "Chengdu University of Technology, China", "Chengdu University of Technology, China", "Chengdu University of Technology, China", "Chengdu University of Technology, China"], "Conference": "BIOTC 2022: 2022 4th Blockchain and Internet of Things Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3559795", "Total_Citations": "0"},

This is largely due to the ability of the technology to (i) efficiently manage the sharing of digital resources between a large number of stakeholders and (ii) to efficiently manage disputes arising in the process. In spite of its many advantages, experience with existing blockchain proposals reveals that there are still many challenges that need to be overcome prior to any large scale industrial adoption, namely [Scalability] Existing permissionless blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin) are able to scale to a considerable number of nodes at the expense of attained throughput (e.g., Bitcoin can only achieve few transactions per second[2]). On the other hand, permission-based blockchains can achieve relatively higher throughput, but can only scale to few hundred nodes. However, one needs to cater for both performance and scalability to meet industrial standards. [Privacy of lightweight clients] Most open blockchain platforms support lightweight clients, targeted for devices like smartphones, that only download and verify a small part of the chain. Here, clients connect to a full node that has access to the complete blockchain and can assist the client in transaction confirmation. As the full node has to learn all transactions issued and received by the requesting client to verify their correctness, such action obviously violates user privacy[1]. In this talk, we plan to overview a number of security challenges pertaining to existing blockchains-effectively capturing almost 8 years of research in this area of work. Moreover, we plan to discuss the performance limitations of existing blockchain-based consensus algorithms and explore different concepts leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enhance the scalability and security of existing consensus algorithms[3].

{"title": "A Variable Bulk Arrival and Static Bulk Service Queueing Model for Blockchain", "date": "06 October 2020", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel embedded Markovian queueing model of the M(1,n)/Mn/1 type in order to establish a theoretical foundation to design a blockchain-based system with specific interest in Ethereum. The model assumes variable bulk arrivals of transactions in Poisson distribution, i.e., M(1,n), where n the number of slots across all the mined transactions and static bulk service of transactions in exponential time, i.e., Mn, for posting in the current block, namely, VBASBP.

The variable bulk arrival rate is assumed to vary linearly proportional to the size of the transactions in a multiple of per slot, and the static bulk service is assumed to take place when the number of slots in the mined transactions reaches at n, i.e., a bulk processing of multiple transactions in multiple slots for posting in a block.

However, the state of the art concepts are not applicable due to several limitations. One limitation is the scalability of blockchains with regard to the number of transactions that can be processed by the network. The well-established technology in tracking products is based on RFID chips that can be cloned. This paper provides insights into how objects can be protected and monitored by a varnish with a unique crack pattern, as an example of a Physical Unclonable Function. The perceptual hash of the unique pattern is used to encrypt the associated data to ensure privacy. Instead of logging each event on the blockchain individually, which is not possible due to the limited transaction throughput, OriginStamp is used to preserve data integrity on the blockchain. OriginStamp aggregates events, combines them through hashing and embeds this hash into a Bitcoin transaction. Once the Bitcoin network mines the transaction into a block and confirms it, the timestamp is considered as immutable proof of existence. With this approach, the integrity of tracking data cannot be contested.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3211933.3211944", "Authors": ["Thomas Hepp", "Patrick Wortner", "Alexander Sch\u00f6nhals", "Bela Gipp"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450358385", "nombredePage": "121  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany", "Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany", "Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany", "Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"], "Conference": "CryBlock'18: Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains for Distributed Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3211933", "Total_Citations": "25"},

Because of its efficiency and functionality, it is widely considered to have revolutionary application prospects. As a supporting part of the data structure, the hash function is important for ensuring the availability and security of the blockchain. To evaluate the security of blockchain technology it is important to analyze several security criteria of the hash functions used in the blockchain. This paper focuses on two security criteria-hiding and puzzle-friendliness-that the hash function should satisfy in the blockchain proposed by Narayanan et al. (Narayanan A, Bonneau J, Felten E, et al. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction. Princeton University Press, 2016). Under the framework of Rogaway?Shrimpton's theory, their definitions are mathematically described and their relation is proved. Also, comparisons between the two criteria and traditional ones in hash functions are made. The conclusions of this paper point out that for hash functions, it is harder to break hiding and puzzle-friendliness than to break preimage resistance, which shows that hash functions proven to be preimage-resistant or tested by preimage cryptanalysis like SHA256 tend to be enough to be used in the corresponding parts of the blockchain design. At the same time, from the attackers' view the conclusions can provide a theoretical basis for studying the potential attacks on and defects that may exist in the structure of the hash functions applied in the blockchain.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3205230.3205238", "Authors": ["Maoning Wang", "Meijiao Duan", "Jianming Zhu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450357586", "nombredePage": "69  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China", "Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China", "Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China"], "Conference": "BCC '18: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies, and Contracts", "doi": "10.1145/3205230", "Total_Citations": "23"},
{"title": "Research on Remote Sensing Data Sharing Model Based on Blockchain Technology", "date": "20 March 2020", "abstract": "Remote sensing data sharing will be an important part of the development of remote sensing. Remote sensing data is of great value, but the government is still the largest buyer behind the massive remote sensing data, and the commercial value of remote sensing has not been well discovered. In the future, data sharing will be one of the most effective methods in order to stimulate the commercial development of remote sensing data. Open sharing of data not only drives innovation in technology and industry, but also breaks down data barriers between various sectors of the economy, and generates great economic value for the country. According to this idea, this paper puts forward the remote sensing data sharing model which can conform to the development under the general trend of remote sensing data sharing. Remote sensing data often involves a series of security issues that need attention, such as land, so it is special. The remote sensing data involved in this paper is limited to commercially available data with the purpose of promoting the commercial development of remote sensing. The remote sensing data sharing envisaged in this paper involves remote sensing data that is built on the basis of being screened, not endangering or disclosing national geographic security information, and such data processing will help make people's life more convenient. Remote sensing data sharing faces three major problems, one is the data is large, and the resulting storage and processing problems, the second is that the data owner loses the control of the data, ownership, and the third is the real-time of remote sensing data, requiring the time of data processing must be timely and fast. We put forward a blockchain-based remote sensing data sharing model, which has the characteristics of cannot be tampered with, decentralized, secure, credible and collective maintenance, which is suitable for solving the security problems of data sharing of remote sensing institutions. We introduce concept cloud to solve data storage problems, and uses edge computing to alleviate data processing problems.

{"title": "A Proof-of-Majority Consensus Protocol for Blockchain-enabled Collaboration Infrastructure of 5G Network Slice Brokers", "date": "06 October 2020", "abstract": "With network slicing technology, 5G changes the classical mobile network business model from a network-operator-oriented business to a more open system with multiple stakeholders. In this context, a network slice broker plays the role of agency between network resource providers and vertical service providers, to lease and provide on-demand network slice services. In practice, a single network slice broker normally owns limited types of network slices. And a collaboration infrastructure could be built up to enable network slice sharing among multiple network slice brokers, so as to improve user experience, and enhance the resource utilization rate. However, a major challenge with such an infrastructure is how to support fair and secure slice trading process among multiple un-trusted network slice providers. Blockchain technology, on the other side, brings in high opportunities to implement a fair and secure trading system without a trusted third-party. In view of this observation, this paper proposes a design of blockchain-enabled collaboration infrastructure for network slice brokers, where a group of registered brokers can trade their network slices in a fair and secure manner. To enhance the accountability of slice trading records, transactions are verified and sorted by each broker node, which are further packed into blocks and appended to a shared ledger maintained by each member in the collaboration network. More specifically, we design a Proof-of-Majority (PoM) consensus protocol to sort slice trading transactions before packing transaction blocks of the shared ledger. Furthermore, an optimization for the basic PoM protocol is discussed, with dependency resolving strategy to improve system performance. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of our proposal.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3384943.3409421", "Authors": ["Wenmin Lin", "Xiaolong Xu", "Lianyong Qi", "Xuyun Zhang", "Wanchun Dou", "Mohammad R.

Therefore, when problems arise -- violations of Service Level Agreements, data corruption, data leakage, security breaches -- both customers and Cloud providers face the challenge of agreeing on which party is to be held responsible.

To understand the players' optimal strategies and the game provider's optimal pricing, we conduct an economic analysis of both the game provider's and players' behaviors. In addition, gas fee, a unique factor in blockchain, is taken into consideration. Specifically, we model the interactions between the game provider and players as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, we model the game provider's optimal pricing problem to maximize his utility using prospect theory (PT) due to the intrinsic demand uncertainty. In Stage II, the players choose the market which can maximize their utility to derive their preferred items. Moreover, our analysis and numerical results show that a game provider who considers the PT modeling should adopt a conservative pricing mechanism to increase his utility. Besides, the primary market is more susceptible to gas fees than the 2CM.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3494106.3528675", "Authors": ["Yu Jiang", "Sizheng Fan", "Wei Cai"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450391757", "nombredePage": "153  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen & Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, Shenzhen, China", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen & Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, Shenzhen, China", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen & Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, Shenzhen, China"], "Conference": "BSCI '22: Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Symposium on Blockchain and Secure Critical Infrastructure", "doi": "10.1145/3494106", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "How Does Blockchain Security Dictate Blockchain Implementation?", "date": "13 November 2021", "abstract": "Blockchain protocols come with a variety of security guarantees. For example, BFT-inspired protocols such as Algorand tend to be secure in the partially synchronous setting, while longest chain protocols like Bitcoin will normally require stronger synchronicity to be secure. Another fundamental distinction, directly relevant to scalability solutions such as sharding, is whether or not a single untrusted user is able to point to certificates, which provide incontrovertible proof of block confirmation. Algorand produces such certificates, while Bitcoin does not. Are these properties accidental? Or are they inherent consequences of the paradigm of protocol design? Our aim in this paper is to understand what, fundamentally, governs the nature of security for permissionless blockchain protocols. Using the framework developed in [12], we prove general results showing that these questions relate directly to properties of the user selection process, i.e. the method (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) which is used to select users with the task of updating state. Our results suffice to establish, for example, that the production of certificates is impossible for proof-of-work protocols, but is automatic for standard forms of proof-of-stake protocols. As a byproduct of our work, we also define a number of security notions and identify the equivalences and inequivalences among them.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484752", "Authors": ["Andrew Lewis-Pye", "Tim Roughgarden"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450384544", "nombredePage": "3558  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom", "Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA"], "Conference": "CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3460120", "Total_Citations": "1"},

An example of such is the commonly used Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, the security concerns with this protocol have presented vital security challenges in most IoT applications. For example, the MQTT protocol does not have secure authentication mechanisms implemented and leaves that task to the developer as all the included native security services are fragile. This paper will present a well-thought approach involving a lightweight authentication and authorization scheme together with a decentralized identity system to manage the users' identities. This mechanism helps in facilitating the authentication for both subscribers and publishers by utilizing a smart contract in Ethereum blockchain to guarantee trust, accountability and preserve user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to prove our work, which involves a decentralized MQTT platform and dashboard using our approach. The usability of this approach was further analyzed, particularly concerning CPU and memory utilization.

{"title": "A Medical Data Sharing Platform Based On Permissioned Blockchains", "date": "10 December 2018", "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly important role in the medical field. AI based on big data analysis and deep learning algorithms has become the core driving force for the future development of the medical industry, but the biggest obstacle to its development is incompleteness and inaccuracy of medical data. The main reason is that medical big data is difficult to achieve sharing. This paper studies and analyzes the problems of medical big data sharing, proposes a medical data sharing platform based on permissioned blockchains (BCs), which uses dual-BCs architecture (Account BC and transaction BC), Concurrent Byzantine Fault Tolerance (CBFT) consensus mechanism, encryption technology and smart contract technology. Account BC (ABC) is used to store user data hash after encryption and transaction BC (TBC) is used to process computing tasks. The use of encryption technology ensures that users have full autonomy in their own medical data. Smart contract technology is used to enable users to set up different access permissions of medical data. A TBC can be used by multiple ABCs and TBC does not save users' medical data, but only obtains users' medical data from ABCs when needs computation. When the computing task is completed, the TBC deletes all users' medical data and packages the operation record to save into ABCs, thereby it realizes data sharing while protecting users' privacy. In addition, this paper compares the functions with other medical data systems, analyzes and compares their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the conclusions and future works of the medical data sharing platform based on BC technology are prospected.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3301403.3301406", "Authors": ["Rong Wang", "Wei-Tek Tsai", "Juan He", "Can Liu", "Qi Li", "Enyan Deng"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450366465", "nombredePage": "32  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Digital Society & Blockchain Laboratory, Beihang University, Beijing, China", "Digital Society & Blockchain Laboratory, Beihang University, Beijing, China", "Digital Society & Blockchain Laboratory, Beihang University, Beijing, China", "Digital Society & Blockchain Laboratory, Beihang University, Beijing, China", "Digital Society & Blockchain Laboratory, Beihang University, Beijing, China", "Beijing Tiande Technologies, Beijing, China"], "Conference": "ICBTA 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Blockchain Technology and Application", "doi": "10.1145/3301403", "Total_Citations": "7"},
{"title": "Secure, Decentralized, Privacy Preserving Machine Learning System Implementation over Blockchain", "date": "02 October 2021", "abstract": "The traditional approach to centralized machine learning has transparency concerns. The future of machine learning is decentralized machine learning. Thus, many technological advance companies including Microsoft are also investing in researching approaches to decentralization in machine learning. With the upliftment of big data technology, designing optimized artificial intelligence algorithms is a must need. At the base of every machine learning algorithm we need data. Data is something that can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound or picture that is not being interpreted and analyzed. This data is not generated by just one party, multiple parties generate such data. The data will be geographically distributed amongst organizations. This pushes the need and research of distributed machine learning algorithms. In the current scenario, there is a central server which will run the machine learning algorithm and produce results, in this system obviously we need to collect all the data at that server itself. If the server is attacked then there is a problem of security of data. Also many organizations would not like to just lend their data to some third party. To address all such issues, we study all the possible ways for implementing a distributed machine learning system and propose a blockchain based distributed conservative system. Mainly, we design a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to learn a general predictive model over the trending blockchain technology, also taking care of Byzantine attack, using the within-N algorithm. Also analysis will be made on different machine learning algorithms and datasets as a part of testing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3475992.3476003", "Authors": ["Adnesh Dhamangaonkar", "Prajwal Adsul", "Rohini Sarode", "Sunil Mane"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450389518", "nombredePage": "82  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["College of Engineering Pune, India", "College of Engineering Pune, India", "College of Engineering Pune, India", "College of Engineering Pune, India"], "Conference": "BIOTC 2021: 2021 3rd Blockchain and Internet of Things Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3475992", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "Developing Cost-Effective Blockchain-Powered Applications: A Case Study of the Gas Usage of Smart Contract Transactions in the Ethereum Blockchain Platform", "date": "09 March 2021", "abstract": "Ethereum is a blockchain platform that hosts and executes smart contracts. Executing a function of a smart contract burns a certain amount of gas units (a.k.a., gas usage). The total gas usage depends on how much computing power is necessary to carry out the execution of the function. Ethereum follows a free-market policy for deciding the transaction fee for executing a transaction. More specifically, transaction issuers choose how much they are willing to pay for each unit of gas (a.k.a., gas price). The final transaction fee corresponds to the gas price times the gas usage. Miners process transactions to gain mining rewards, which come directly from these transaction fees. The flexibility and the inherent complexity of the gas system pose challenges to the development of blockchain-powered applications. Developers of blockchain-powered applications need to translate requests received in the frontend of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Yet, it is unclear how developers should set the gas parameters of these transactions given that (i) miners are free to prioritize transactions whichever way they wish and (ii) the gas usage of a contract transaction is only known after the transaction is processed and included in a new block. In this article, we analyze the gas usage of Ethereum transactions that were processed between Oct. 2017 and Feb. 2019 (the Byzantium era). We discover that (i) most miners prioritize transactions based on their gas price only, (ii) 25% of the functions that received at least 10 transactions have an unstable gas usage (coefficient of variation = 19%), and (iii) a simple prediction model that operates on the recent gas usage of a function achieves an R-Squared of 0.76 and a median absolute percentage error of 3.3%. We conclude that (i) blockchain-powered application developers should be aware that transaction prioritization in Ethereum is frequently done based solely on the gas price of transactions (e.g., a higher transaction fee does not necessarily imply a higher transaction priority) and act accordingly and (ii) blockchain-powered application developers can leverage gas usage prediction models similar to ours to make more informed decisions to set the gas price of their transactions.

{"title": "Blockchain Hash, the Missing Axis of the Accounts to Settle the Triple Entry Bookkeeping System", "date": "02 December 2020", "abstract": "The bookkeeping accounting method recognized all over the world is based on the so-called double entry, with which in each account (defined T-Account for its shape) there are two sections, Debit and Credit. These two sections take on different meanings depending on the nature of each account. The double entry is an exceptional consolidated accounting method that dates back to the fifteenth century, however it has highlighted limits in terms of auditing. The single entry did not take into account the cross relations between the accounts, reporting only on the journal. The double entry has overcome this limit by introducing the ledger, but a cross-check of the mirrored transactions recorded by the other companies is still missing. The introduction of blockchain technology could now offer a new opportunity to ensure further auditing control. The transition from double entry to triple entry is therefore only a matter of time. The blockchain itself is borrowing the word \"ledger\" from accounting and now it is time for accounting to introduce a third leg (another axis) to the T-Accounts, that can be turned into a new X-shaped version of accounts.

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner\u2019s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices.

A server encapsulates all the current transactions into a block based on which real-time quantum key services can be realized.

However, new businesses still find it challenging to enter a supply chain, because unauthorised IoT devices of different companies illegally access resources. As security is paramount in a supply chain, IoT management has become very difficult. Public resources allocation and waste management also pose a problem. To solve the above problems, we proposed a new IoT management framework that embraces blockchain technology to help companies to form a supply chain effectively. This framework consists of an access control system, a backup peer mechanism and an internal data isolation and transmission approach. The access control system has a registrar module and an inspection module. The registrar module is mainly responsible for information registration with a registration policy, which has to be followed by all the companies in the supply chain. Besides, it provides a revocation and updating function. The inspection module focuses on judging misbehaviour and monitors the actions of the subjects; when any misoperation occurs, the system will correspondingly penalise violators. So that all related actions and information are verified and stored into blockchain, the IoT access control and safety of IoT admission are enhanced. Furthermore, in a blockchain system, if one single peer in the network breaks down, then the whole system may stop, because consensus cannot be reached. The data of the broken peer may be lost if it does not commit yet. The backup peer mechanism allows the primary peer and the backup peer to connect to an inspecting server for acquiring real-time data. The internal data isolation and transmission modules transmit and stores private data without creating a new subchannel. The proposed method is taken full account of the stability of the network and the fault tolerance to guarantee the robust of the system. To obtain unbiases results, experiments are conducted in two different blockchain environment. The results show our proposed method are promising IoT blockchain system for the supply chain.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3409798", "Authors": ["Qun Song", "Yuhao Chen", "Yan Zhong", "Kun Lan", "Simon Fong", "Rui Tang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1533-5399", "nombredePage": "534  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["ZIAT DACC Laboratory, Zhuhai Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhuhai, China", "ZIAT DACC Laboratory, Zhuhai Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhuhai, China", "ZIAT DACC Laboratory, Zhuhai Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhuhai, China", "ZIAT DACC Laboratory, Zhuhai Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhuhai, China", "ZIAT DACC Laboratory, Zhuhai Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhuhai, China", "Faculty of management and economics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Internet Technology", "doi": "1557-6051", "Total_Citations": "23"},
{"title": "Benchmarks and Models for Blockchain", "date": "30 March 2018", "abstract": "Blockchain is a highly popular paradigm for non-centralized applications, especially in finance and trade. Performance is a major challenge for blockchains, since consensus approaches are known not to scale. In this presentation we address blockchain performance, from the perspective of model-based prediction as well as benchmark-based assessment. We present research results about smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain and discuss the requirements for generic benchmarks for blockchain performance. Benchmarking is a common approach to compare industry-class systems. As blockchain technologies mature, the role of reliable benchmarks will become increasingly important. However, definitions of benchmarks for blockchains are still in their infancy. We argue that there is a clear need for benchmarks, and that benchmarks should be based on the sound scientific principles of metrology [1]. A variety of important performance issues should be addressed, including the performance of the proof (be it work, stake, or other), transaction processing and block creation. Moreover, in all these situations, establishing energy consumption benchmarks is critical in determining if incentives are in place for miners to operate the blockchain system. A particularly interesting element in some blockchains is the mechanism of smart contracts. For instance, in Ethereum, the fees associated with executing contracts depend on the benchmarked performance of the operation code. In [2] it was demonstrated that uncertainty with respect to the correctness of the anticipated execution time impacts the decisions miners will take. We will discuss improved benchmarking approaches for operational code.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3184407.3184441", "Authors": ["Aad van Moorsel"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["keynote"], "ISBN": "9781450350952", "nombredePage": "328  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"], "Conference": "ICPE '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering", "doi": "10.1145/3184407", "Total_Citations": "2"},

{"title": "Design Thinking using the Blockchain: Enable Traceability of Intellectual Property in Problem-Solving Processes for Open Innovation", "date": "15 June 2018", "abstract": "In this vision paper, we present an approach that makes it possible to protect developed ideas and early concepts even during their systematical development. We take the Design Thinking process as an example, in which interfaces are used for individual stages (understand, observe, define, ideate, prototype, test) to digitally record verbal, written or sketched, and even modeled or constructed outcome. This outcome is recorded and linked to the originating person. To guarantee both proof-of-existence and proof-of-origin, a unique hash is generated from each digital artifact stored and embedded into the Bitcoin Blockchain by the OriginStamp decentralized trusted timestamping service. Once this unique fingerprint is embedded in a transaction in the underlying Blockchain network, it can be proven where particular contributions originated due to the characteristics of Blockchain architecture. By setting up a decentralized tamper-proof means of record keeping, the entire innovation chain from the first ideation to the beginning of production is verifiably stored. By providing a clear proof-of-origin, all innovators (even competitors) could continue to work on existing problem-solving process and add their contribution proportionately, depending on the state of innovation development. This concept enables an Open Innovation ecosystem, which has the potential to increase the innovation potential of companies immensely.

{"title": "BDoS: Blockchain Denial-of-Service", "date": "02 November 2020", "abstract": "Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency blockchains like Bitcoin secure vast amounts of money. Their operators, called miners, expend resources to generate blocks and receive monetary rewards for their effort. Blockchains are, in principle, attractive targets for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: There is fierce competition among coins, as well as potential gains from short selling. Classical DoS attacks, however, typically target a few servers and cannot scale to systems with many nodes. There have been no successful DoS attacks to date against prominent cryptocurrencies. We present Blockchain DoS (BDoS), the first incentive-based DoS attack that targets PoW cryptocurrencies. Unlike classical DoS, BDoS targets the system's mechanism design: It exploits the reward mechanism to discourage miner participation. Previous DoS attacks against PoW blockchains require an adversary's mining power to match that of all other miners. In contrast, BDoS can cause a blockchain to grind to a halt with significantly fewer resources, e.g., 21% as of March 2020 in Bitcoin, according to our empirical study. We find that Bitcoin's vulnerability to BDoS increases rapidly as the mining industry matures and profitability drops. BDoS differs from known attacks like Selfish Mining in its aim not to increase an adversary's revenue, but to disrupt the system. Although it bears some algorithmic similarity to those attacks, it introduces a new adversarial model, goals, algorithm, and game-theoretic analysis. Beyond its direct implications for operational blockchains, BDoS introduces the novel idea that an adversary can manipulate miners' incentives by proving the existence of blocks without actually publishing them.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3372297.3417247", "Authors": ["Michael Mirkin", "Yan Ji", "Jonathan Pang", "Ariah Klages-Mundt", "Ittay Eyal", "Ari Juels"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450370899", "nombredePage": "2180  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Technion and IC3, Haifa, Israel", "Cornell Tech and IC3, New York, NY, USA", "Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA", "Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA", "Technion and IC3, Haifa, Israel", "Cornell Tech and IC3, New York, NY, USA"], "Conference": "CCS '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3372297", "Total_Citations": "21"},

However, while developing rapidly, the existing CP-ABE access schemes also face some problems, such as trustworthiness issues involving third-party intermediary entities, secret key management problems brought by single attribute authorization centers, and privacy leakage of attributes. How to achieve safe and effective decentralized access control has been a problem to be explored and solved. In this paper, a trustworthy, secure, and efficient ABE(TSE ABE) based on blockchain and fast attribute-based message encryption (FAME) is proposed by us. First, we combine blockchain and FAME and optimize them to make CP-ABE perform better. Second, we implement a trusted authorization model with multiple entities based on the BLS signature and smart contracts to address key privacy issues. Finally, we protect the privacy of attributes in the authorization matching process by RSA encryption algorithm.

Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance.

{"title": "Overview of Blockchain Consensus Mechanism", "date": "05 July 2020", "abstract": "The advent of the Bitcoin system has brought another boom in the Internet era. In a very short time, many Blockchain systems come into being successively, whose decentration, consensus mechanisms, intelligent contract, and other characteristics make them applicable to various fields such as finance, education, medical, technology, etc. The consensus mechanism is the core of Blockchain technology. And a good consensus mechanism plays a very important role in the stable operation of the Blockchain system. The continuous improvement of consensus mechanisms such as PoW (proof-of-work), PoS (proof-of-stake), DPoS (delegated-proof-of-stake), and PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) has led to the evolution of Blockchain technology to Blockchain 3.0. Starting from the issue of Byzantine generals, this article analyzes common consensus mechanisms based on existing Blockchain applications and then evaluates their consistency. This paper has a unique perspective, selection and comment on the latest progress and important literature in the field of block chain.

Managing DoS attacks is even harder in peer-to-peer projects because of multiple equal in rights nodes (miners or maintainers) that communicate across the globe to secure the network. In most blockchains, users can send transactions. Moreover, as a systems throughput is limited, the ability to send transactions should be limited in some honest and transparent way. Otherwise, the pool of unconfirmed (pending) transactions mempool could be overloaded, and it may cause DoS. In Bitcoin, users pay a fee for each transaction to address this issue. Steem.io introduced an alternative approach based on the fractional reservation of the blockchain block space. This approach is an adaptation of similar ones from the network routing and banking systems. The block space fractional reservation for blockchains in terms of a score function is introduced in this paper. Authors made a private blockchain project demo on Exonum framework.

In our paradigm, we show that our n-hop design can be easily extended to (n + 1)-hop design.

{"title": "Towards Scaling Blockchain Systems via Sharding", "date": "25 June 2019", "abstract": "Existing blockchain systems scale poorly because of their distributed consensus protocols. Current attempts at improving blockchain scalability are limited to cryptocurrency. Scaling blockchain systems under general workloads (i.e., non-cryptocurrency applications) remains an open question. This work takes a principled approach to apply sharding to blockchain systems in order to improve their transaction throughput at scale. This is challenging, however, due to the fundamental difference in failure models between databases and blockchain. To achieve our goal, we first enhance the performance of Byzantine consensus protocols, improving individual shards' throughput. Next, we design an efficient shard formation protocol that securely assigns nodes into shards. We rely on trusted hardware, namely Intel SGX, to achieve high performance for both consensus and shard formation protocol. Third, we design a general distributed transaction protocol that ensures safety and liveness even when transaction coordinators are malicious. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our design both on a local cluster and on Google Cloud Platform. The results show that our consensus and shard formation protocols outperform state-of-the-art solutions at scale.

In the technical respect, these incidents are partially due to the fact that existing vaccine management systems are distributively managed by different entities in the vaccine supply chain. This architecture makes it relatively easy to modify or even delete the vaccine circulation data maliciously, which makes tracing problematic vaccine hard and identifying the responsibility for a vaccine accident hard. To solve these issues, this article presents a blockchain-based solution to protect the whole process of vaccine circulation. We first propose a model to supervise the vaccine circulation process by incorporating existing regulatory practices. Then, we propose a blockchain-based tracing system to implement this model. The proposed system takes the blockchain as a global, unique, and verifiable database to store all the circulation data. Through data insertions and queries on the global and unique database, the proposed system achieves the protection of vaccine circulation.

This is an activity-based micro-pricing system implemented on cryptocurrency technologies. Activity-based micro-pricing is a pervasive technology to influence people's behavior through economic incentives. Implementing activity-based micro-pricing based on cryptocurrency technologies enables us to solve potential technical issues of traditional implementation. The Blockchain-LI architecture adopts a hierarchical currency network containing two types of currencies. The public coin is widely prevalent and has high integrity.

However, it is still not clear how and in what ways blockchain technologies can improve this. This study examines the mechanisms and capability of blockchain technology to contribute to improved transparency and accountability in government. We use a set of system transparency and accountability concepts and mechanisms to critically assess the capabilities of blockchain. By means of a land registration case in Indonesia, we investigate the effects of blockchain on the transparency and accountability of the system. Creating transparency and accountability might be more difficult than expected, as non-technical issues need to be addressed. Based on our assessment we discuss key issues, including digital ID, privacy, interoperability, connectivity and technology aware population, computational efficiency and storage size, acceptability, check and control mechanism, data validity, digital signature, algorithm transparency, law and regulation support, and dispute resolution, that must be considered in developing a transparent and accountable blockchain-based e-Government system.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3325112.3325262", "Authors": ["F.

These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs.

In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios.

{"title": "Blockchain Anchoring of Public Registries: Options and Challenges", "date": "03 April 2019", "abstract": "Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing-or the insertion of data in the blockchain (anchoring)-is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The objective of this paper is to analyse the use of data hashing (anchoring) on the blockchain for public state-owned registries. This paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related with concepts such as \"distributed ledger technology\" and \"permissioned blockchains.\" Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need to identify pain points in governance in the first place, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3326365.3326406", "Authors": ["Oleksii Konashevych", "Marta Poblet"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450366441", "nombredePage": "538  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Erasmus Mundus Joint International Doctoral Fellow in Law, Science, and Technology, LAST-JD.eu, European Union", "RMIT University, Graduate School of Business and Law, Melbourne VIC, Australia"], "Conference": "ICEGOV2019: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance", "doi": "10.1145/3326365", "Total_Citations": "2"},

However, HCI research has so far failed to address them, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is problematic as these new blockchains come with an increasingly diverse set of properties that influence the usability of dApps for end-users. For blockchain interface design guidelines to be valuable for practitioners, they need to acknowledge the heterogeneity of blockchains. However, evaluating novel interface concepts across different blockchains is resource-intensive as each blockchain has to be integrated manually, slowing down research. To address this challenge, we propose a system to support interface experimentation for blockchain applications. The system allows researchers and developers to connect interfaces to a unified API simulating different blockchains and facilitates the configuration, distribution, and evaluation of online experiments.

For the first time, a conceptual analysis is conducted on process level to spot benefits and limitations of Blockchain-based governance. Per process element, Blockchain key characteristics are mapped to functional aspects of NPG from a governance perspective. The preliminary results show that Blockchain offers valuable support for governments seeking methods to effectively coordinate co-producing networks. However, the extent of benefits of Blockchain varies across the process elements. It becomes evident that there is a need for off-chain processes.

These elections range from either boardroom elections, local elections to national elections. Correspondingly, electioneering as an institutional process has transformed with both technological advancements as well political sophistication. Blockchain as a nascent technology has ushered in a range of opportunities in different sectors such as finance, real estate, supply chain management, medical records, elections etc. In this paper, we leveraged on some of the key characteristics of Blockchain technology in form of immutability, auditability, confidentiality, transparency, decentralization etc to develop a Blockchain eVoting network system that can be utilized for geographically dispersed elections. Key users of the system or actors were isolated and their interactions with the system identified using Use Case Methodology. The system actors are the voters, miners that consists of Universities and public libraries, central authority, candidates and the voters. The different stages of an election process such as pre-election, registration of both candidates and voters, voting/balloting, tallying and auditing were equally enumerated. The interactions of the actors with the system were equally captured, analyzed and used to develop the conceptual system. The proposed system is made up of a multichain Blockchain network, an arbitration server, distributed database, an interactive, multi-device graphic user interface GUI, and an application server. To engender anonymity, a combination of Digital Signature and Secure Hash Algorithm SHA was proposed, also Proof of Work PoW was the proposed consensus algorithm.

{"title": "Learning Analytics' Privacy on the Blockchain", "date": "24 October 2018", "abstract": "Learning Analytics collect sensitive data from students. In some cases, the ethics behind the use or access by third parties are not clear. This situation raises adverse reactions and feelings of fear that generates a negative perception towards the use of Learning Analytics. In consequence, it is questioned whether privacy and security can be preserved when collecting educational data. As a result, some policies and good practices are set to frame how student data should be used in the application of this analytical approach. Its objective is to increase confidence in the application of Learning Analytics. However, some of these legal actions, which are limited to the areas in which they are originated, are the result of allegations of data leakage. Hence, these initiatives can do little to insure the use of sensitive data of students in unknown situations. To ensure continuity and an increase of confidence in the application of Learning Analytics is necessary to bind to legality a new approach to safeguard privacy of students' data in its current and future uses. Considering the above, it is possible to add a technological layer above these policies that ensures its viability. Some emerging technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts are strong candidates to ensure privacy and secure sensible data of students. The use of smart contracts allows the automation of legal actions so that they are executed as soon as irregularities in the use or data collection are detected. In this work, we propose a series of actions to preserve the identity of students and secure their data with emerging technologies such as blockchain.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3284179.3284231", "Authors": ["Marc Alier Forment", "Daniel Amo Filv\u00e0", "Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1alvo", "David Fonseca Escudero", "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Casa\u00f1"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450365185", "nombredePage": "1072  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, UPC Campus Nord, Ed.

{"title": "An FPGA NIC Based Hardware Caching for Blockchain", "date": "07 June 2017", "abstract": "These days, people pay attention to Blockchain, which is a main technology of cryptocurrency. Blockchain is a fault-tolerant distributed ledger that does not need an administrator. We call transfer of digital asset as a \"transaction\". We need to hold all transactions to use Blockchain. Therefore, the amount of Blockchain data increases as time proceeds. On the other hand, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) products has been increasing. It is difficult for IoT products to hold all Blockchain data because of their data capacity. Thus, they access Blockchain network via servers that have enough data capacity. More and more IoT products will join Blockchain network via servers, so it is useful to reduce workloads and improve throughput. In this paper, we propose caching technique using a Field Programmable Gate Array-based (FPGA) Network Interface Card (NIC) that has 10Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) interfaces. FPGA NIC instead of the server responds to requests from IoT products if the cache hits. The proposed system can reduce server workloads. We implemented the proposed hardware cache to achieve high throughput on NetFPGA-10G board. We counted the number of requests that the Blockchain server processed at a given time and calculated throughput as evaluation. Throughput improved from 6.73 to 7.45 times when hitting the cache.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3120895.3120897", "Authors": ["Yuma Sakakibara", "Kohei Nakamura", "Hiroki Matsutani"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450353168", "nombredePage": "172  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan", "Keio University, Yokohama, Japan", "Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"], "Conference": "HEART2017: Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies", "doi": "10.1145/3120895", "Total_Citations": "10"},

However, most of the existing schemes either require their users to bear extra storage costs to manage keys, or need one more private communication before each transaction. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed a new kind of stealth addresses scheme in which a user only needs to keep a single key pair for initial certificate, the user only stores his or her initial key pair for all transactions. In our scheme, when a sender initiates a transaction, he or she creates a one-time transaction address, then the sender attaches it to the transaction. The receiver uses his or her private key to check the transaction from the blockchain, no private channel is needed for each transaction. Considering regulatory issues, transactions can be wholly or partially regulated, depending on security requirements.

With the advent of blockchain technology, there is a new central opportunity to create trust on digital platforms such as those used for online help services. After clarification of relevant concepts and terms, diverse forms of the blockchain technology are explained on the basis of the individually specific configuration of a blockchain.

The system must maintain a large Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low failure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this paper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up to n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and every Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that this design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one class) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more Shards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The improved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation for decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3341105.3374069", "Authors": ["Yibin Xu", "Yangyu Huang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["poster"], "ISBN": "9781450368667", "nombredePage": "2348  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University Cardiff, Wales, UK", "University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, Guangxi, China"], "Conference": "SAC '20: Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3341105", "Total_Citations": "6"},

{"title": "An Empirical Study of Blockchain Repositories in GitHub", "date": "13 June 2022", "abstract": " Blockchain is a distributed ledger technique that guarantees the traceability of transactions. Blockchain is adopted in multiple domains like finance (e.g., cryptocurrency), healthcare, security, and supply chain. In the open-source software (OSS) portal GitHub, we observe a growing adoption of Blockchain-based solutions. Given the rapid emergence of Blockchain-based solutions in our daily life and the evolving cryptocurrency market, it is important to know the status quo, how developers generally interact in those repos, and how much freedom they have in applying code changes. We report an empirical study of 3,664 Blockchain software repositories from GitHub. We divide the Blockchain repositories into two categories: Tool (e.g., SDKs) and Applications (e.g., service/solutions developed using SDKs). The Application category is further divided into two sub-categories: Crypto and Non-Crypto applications. In all Blockchain repository categories, the contribution interactions on commits are the most common interaction type. We found that more organizations contributing to the Blockchain repos than individual users. The median numbers of internal and external users in tools are higher than the application repos. We observed a higher degree of collaboration (e.g., for maintenance efforts) among users in Blockchain tools than those in the application repos.

{"title": "A Better Method to Analyze Blockchain Consistency", "date": "15 October 2018", "abstract": "The celebrated Nakamoto consensus protocol [16] ushered in several new consensus applications including cryptocurrencies. A few recent works [7, 17] have analyzed important properties of blockchains, including most significantly, consistency, which is a guarantee that all honest parties output the same sequence of blocks throughout the execution of the protocol. To establish consistency, the prior analysis of Pass, Seeman and Shelat [17] required a careful counting of certain combinatorial events that was difficult to apply to variations of Nakamoto. The work of Garay, Kiayas, and Leonardas [7] provides another method of analyzing the blockchain under the simplifying assumption that the network was synchronous. The contribution of this paper is the development of a simple Markov-chain based method for analyzing consistency properties of blockchain protocols. The method includes a formal way of stating strong concentration bounds as well as easy ways to concretely compute the bounds. We use our new method to answer a number of basic questions about consistency of blockchains: Our new analysis provides a tighter guarantee on the consistency property of Nakamoto's protocol, including for parameter regimes which [17] could not consider; We analyze a family of delaying attacks first presented in [17], and extend them to other protocols; We analyze how long a participant should wait before considering a high-value transaction \"confirmed\"; We analyze the consistency of CliqueChain, a variation of the Chainweb [14] system; We provide the first rigorous consistency analysis of GHOST [20] and also analyze a folklore \"balancing\"-attack. In each case, we use our framework to experimentally analyze the consensus bounds for various network delay parameters and adversarial computing percentages. We hope our techniques enable authors of future blockchain proposals to provide a more rigorous analysis of their schemes.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243814", "Authors": ["Lucianna Kiffer", "Rajmohan Rajaraman", "abhi shelat"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450356930", "nombredePage": "2359  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA", "Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA", "Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"], "Conference": "CCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3243734", "Total_Citations": "47"},

For both researchers and industry IoT appears a domain in which there would be extraordinary benefits if the features of Blockchain can be exploited. Indeed, the possibility that IoT devices participate in public shared transactions enables a lot of challenging applications. However, there are some aspects that may limit the use of Blockchain in IoT. These are mainly related to the low computational power and storage capabilities of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to implement a public ledger overcoming the above drawbacks, thus appearing more suitable to IoT applications. The proposed protocol leverages the popular social network Twitter and works by building a meshed chain of tweets to ensure transaction security.

{"title": "Inter Blockchain Communication: A Survey", "date": "07 March 2019", "abstract": "Blockchain technology is growing massively where the number of blockchain platforms and decentralized applications are increasing rapidly in the last years. However, most of the existing blockchain networks are operating in a standalone environment isolated from each other, which increases scalability and connectivity issues in the current blockchain platforms as well as limiting the blockchain adoption in industry ecosystems. In the current phase, different blockchain networks don't have mutual trust where they cannot interact with each other and their capacity level has only reached a level similar to LAN. Due to the high barriers between the independent isolated blockchain platforms, researchers have started to focus on the concept of Blockchain interoperability. Blockchain interoperability is the ability of connecting multiple blockchain networks together, which significantly increases and solves scalability and connectivity issues in the blockchain platforms. Given the potential of blockchain interoperability and cross blockchain communication, many researchers are working on finding the optimal cross blockchain communication solution. As blockchain interoperability is emerging as an essential blockchain feature, the number of proposed blockchain interoperability solutions have been increasing within the last few years.

This paper proposes a blockchain-based microgrid distributed power trading mechanism that provides consumers with the opportunity to contribute to the grid through renewable energy. By integrating a smart microgrid, the system will remain functional during isolation from the national grid, while allowing energy within the system to be consumed nearby. Through aggregation agents in the microgrid and infrastructure such as smart electricity meters, participants can share the generated energy for profit.

It is imperative to maintain proper evidence management to guarantee the admissibility of an evidence in a court of law. Chain of custody forms the forensic link of evidence sequence of control, transfer, and analysis to preserve evidence's integrity and to prevent its contamination. Blockchain, a distributed tamper-resistant ledger can be leveraged to offer a decentralized secure digital evidence system. In this paper, we propose a secure chain of custody framework by utilizing the blockchain technology to store evidence metadata while the evidence is stored in a reliable storage medium. The framework is built on top of a private Ethereum blockchain to document every transmission from the moment the evidence is seized, thus ensuring that evidence can only be accessed or possessed by authorized parties. The framework is integrated with the digital evidence system where evidence is physically stored and locked using smart locks. To secure the sequence of evidence submission and retrieval, only an authorized party can possess the key to unlock the evidence. Our proposed framework offers a secure solution that maintains evidence integrity and admissibility among multiple stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies, lawyers, and forensic professionals.

{"title": "Blockchain-Based Audio Watermarking Technique for Multimedia Copyright Protection in Distribution Networks", "date": "04 March 2022", "abstract": "Copyright protection in multimedia protection distribution is a challenging problem. To protect multimedia data, many watermarking methods have been proposed in the literature. However, most of them cannot be used effectively in a multimedia distribution network (MDN) as they are not designed to support multi-layer watermark embedding. Multi-layer watermarking mechanisms were developed to protect multimedia data across different layers in an MDN. However, in those mechanisms, we need to trust the entities in the MDN, such as regional and country distributors. To overcome this potential drawback, in this article, we propose a novel privacy protection mechanism for MDNs by combining the advantages of both blockchain and watermarking technologies. A specifically designed watermarking algorithm is used to link the copyright information with the audio file, while a novel blockchain-based smart contract mechanism is developed to enforce the proper functioning of each entity in the distribution network. Moreover, the new audio mechanism is computationally efficient. Although audio signals are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, the proposed approach can easily be extended to other multimedia objects, such as an image. The validity of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by our simulation results. The proposed mechanism can benefit multimedia production companies and other entities in the MDN.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3492803", "Authors": ["Iynkaran Natgunanathan", "Purathani Praitheeshan", "Longxiang Gao", "Yong Xiang", "Lei Pan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1551-6857", "nombredePage": "478  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia", "Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia", "Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia", "Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia", "Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications", "doi": "1551-6865", "Total_Citations": "0"},

With the advancement of blockchain, it has been concerned in some studies that auditing could be significantly impacted and eventually replaced.

This discussion can hardly be settled without evaluation, however, studies exploring how blockchain technology can be employed in auditing practice or how continuous auditing can be conducted using blockchain technology are limited. This paper analyses the impact of blockchain features on existing audit processes and discusses the possibility of applying blockchain characteristics including immutability, distributed ledger, real-time settlement to the auditing domain.

However, conventional voting systems tend to be centralized, which are known to suffer from security and efficiency limitations. Hence, there has been a trend of moving to decentralized voting systems, such as those based on blockchain. The latter is a decentralized digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network, where a copy of the append-only ledger of digitally signed and encrypted transactions is maintained by each participant. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of blockchain-based voting systems and classify them based on a number of features (e.g., the types of blockchain used, the consensus approaches used, and the scale of participants). By systematically analyzing and comparing the different blockchain-based voting systems, we also identify a number of limitations and research opportunities.

However, training a deep learning model for image fusion usually requires enormous computing power, especially for large volumes of medical data. Meanwhile, the privacy of images is also a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based medical image fusion (BMIF) framework. First, to ensure fusion performance, we design a new medical image fusion model based on convolutional neural network and Inception network, and integrate the proposed model into the consensus process of blockchain. Next, to save computing power of blockchain, we design a consensus mechanism by requesting consensus nodes to train the fusion model instead of calculating useless hash values in traditional blockchain. Then, to protect data privacy, we further present an efficient homomorphic encryption to realize the training of fusion model on encrypted medical data. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on public datasets to evaluate the feasibility and the performance of our proposed BMIF. The results exhibit that BMIF is efficient and secure, and our medical image fusion network performs better than state-of-the-art approaches.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3531016", "Authors": ["Tao Xiang", "Honghong Zeng", "Biwen Chen", "Shangwei Guo"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1551-6857", "nombredePage": null, "AuthorsFormation": ["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, China", "0000-0002-9439-4623", "College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, China", "0000-0001-5561-856X", "College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, China", "0000-0002-7314-8271", "College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, China", "0000-0002-6443-5308"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications", "doi": "1551-6865", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "Towards an Optimized BlockChain for IoT", "date": "18 April 2017", "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in adopting BlockChain (BC), that underpins the crypto-currency Bitcoin, in Internet of Things (IoT) for security and privacy. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for most IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight BC-based architecture for IoT that virtually eliminates the overheads of classic BC, while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. IoT devices benefit from a private immutable ledger, that acts similar to BC but is managed centrally, to optimize energy consumption. High resource devices create an overlay network to implement a publicly accessible distributed BC that ensures end-to-end security and privacy. The proposed architecture uses distributed trust to reduce the block validation processing time. We explore our approach in a smart home setting as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications. Simulations demonstrate that our method decreases packet and processing overhead significantly compared to the BC implementation used in Bitcoin.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3054977.3055003", "Authors": ["Ali Dorri", "Salil S.

{"title": "Solar Energy Distribution Using Blockchain and IoT Integration", "date": "07 July 2019", "abstract": "This research focuses on the decentralised distribution of solar energy between networks using IoT (Internet of Things) enabled devices and Blockchain technology. IoT provides a medium for software part to interact with the physical part which is energy and transmission grid. IoT connects the physical battery containing the energy to the cloud database which is then used to interact with the software. IoT also enables the transfer of energy through the physical medium on the command given by the user through the user application. To make the system decentralized, blockchain is used, which helps to connect all the users in the network where they can transact without the need of knowing each other or having the obligation of any intermediary. Decentralisation helps in achieving a system which doesn't require any middleman and works on the cumulative trust of the nodes - often referred to as the Consensus-Based Algorithm. There are a number of such algorithms but Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are widely used for blockchains. We suggest using the PoW algorithm. We need to take care if the certain conditions meet before enabling any user to transact. For such condition, we used the application logic on the server side to enable a valid transaction (similar to smart contracts on Ethereum).

Blockchain technique has high accountability and thus has potential to improve the transparency and security of knowledge sharing. In this paper, to address the above problems, first we propose a Reputation Based Knowledge Sharing system in blockchain, called RBKS. The aim of RBKS is to exploit the copyright protection of the knowledge owner using our proposed fine-grained access control system, and to achieve the paid-for content service which allows bystanders who are interested in the shared knowledge to pay a small fee for the access. Second, a reputation evaluation algorithm is introduced as the core of the incentive, and it may possibly be combined with stake in blockchain to form a hybrid stake for the RBKS system. Third, a blockchain and a trusted storage server are employed together for sharing and storing knowledge, and the main procedures are implemented with smart contract in blockchain to ensure secure execution and fairness. Finally, our analysis shows that the RBKS system is feasible and secure.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3286978.3286981", "Authors": ["Shuang Hu", "Lin Hou", "Gongliang Chen", "Jian Weng", "Jianhua Li"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450360937", "nombredePage": "490  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University & SKLIATIS, Shanghai, China, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA", "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University & SKLIATIS, Shanghai, China", "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University & SKLIATIS, Shanghai, China"], "Conference": "MobiQuitous '18: Proceedings of the 15th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services", "doi": "10.1145/3286978", "Total_Citations": "8"},

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication scheme in VANETs. We explore the strategy of a local blockchain for VANETs. We make use of a private blockchain for authentication and a public blockchain for managing event messages. The trusted authority (TA) is responsible for making the transactions in the private blockchain within the boundary of the countries, the transactions are the identity information required for authentication of vehicles when they join the network for the first time, the other vehicles have the right to read and check from the private blockchain the authenticity of a new vehicle. The public blockchain is used for storing the event messages within the boundary of pre-defined regions to ensure the security of message dissemination, we called this kind of blockchain road-side unit blockchain (RSU-BC) because it takes the role of RSU in a VANET. In this way, we eliminate the necessity of RSU's deployment in VANETs and reduce the dependency on the TA.

{"title": "GDPR-Compliant Use of Blockchain for Secure Usage Logs", "date": "21 June 2021", "abstract": " The unique properties of blockchain enable central requirements of distributed secure logging: Immutability, integrity, and availability. Especially when providing transparency about data usages, a blockchain-based secure log can be beneficial, as no trusted third party is required. Yet, with data governed by privacy legislation such as the GDPR or CCPA, the core advantage of immutability becomes a liability. After a rightful request, an individual\u2019s personal data need to be rectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain. To solve this issue, we exploit a legal property of pseudonymized data: They are only regarded personal data if they can be associated with an individual\u2019s identity. We make use of this fact by presenting P3, a pseudonym provisioning system for secure usage logs including a protocol for recording new usages. For each new block, a one-time transaction pseudonym is generated. The pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees unlinkability and enables proof of ownership. These properties enable GDPR-compliant use of blockchain, as data subjects can exercise their legal rights with regards to their personal data. The new-usage protocol ensures non-repudiation, and therefore accountability and liability.

Motivated by this, a self-defying adversary model is proposed that uses ZEBRA (Zero Expectation-Based Reward Abuse) strategy to cause a maximum impact on the rewards of the honest players at lower settings. With the proposed method, the adversary itself may not be profitable, but has better control over the chain growth and causes maximum damage to reward by delaying the blocks and inducing forks subject to its compliance degree. The evaluations are demonstrated to show the reward control by the adversary along with the impact on delays and forks, followed by the possibilities of attacks using the hashing powers of different mining pools.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3488932.3497757", "Authors": ["Vishal Sharma", "Pawel Szalachowski", "Jianying Zhou"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450391405", "nombredePage": "1291  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom", "Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore, Singapore", "Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore, Singapore"], "Conference": "ASIA CCS '22: Proceedings of the 2022 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3488932", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "Blockchain-based RBAC for user authentication with anonymity", "date": "24 September 2019", "abstract": "RBAC is a traditional approach of controlling who wants to access resources in a computer system through a permission to a role. Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can permanently record transactions. Smart Contract facilitates negotiations for a trustless transaction by enabling automatic payment. It is currently being applied to various kinds of business applications. In a smart contract that requires payment with cryptocurrency, if access control is performed only without individual authentication, progress for applications to various fields will be restricted. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based RBAC with an authentication mechanism that can provides role-based access control while also providing individual account-based authentication. We have defined three interfaces based on blockchain to realize it. The proposed mechanism provides anonymity-based authentication by using a hash function with a pass that is indistinguishable from the owner. This was simulated on an Ethereum-based test network and compared with existing methods. The proposed mechanism not only added authentication methods, but also was more efficient in gas use and performance time than the existing RBAC model.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3338840.3355673", "Authors": ["YongJoo Lee", "Keon Myung Lee"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450368438", "nombredePage": "323  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["ChungBuk National University, Korea", "ChungBuk National University, Korea"], "Conference": "RACS '19: Proceedings of the Conference on Research in Adaptive and Convergent Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3338840", "Total_Citations": "8"},

When voters could trust that the voting results are valid, people are willing to trust this voter will serve for them dealing with issues such as national security, education, and economics in the future. Electronic voting is an efficient method that could help people who could not vote in a limited period. Besides, it also solves the problem of long voting time due to many voters or more complicated voting steps. Although the voting machine could perform a record of votes and voting calculations, it does not require humans to handle a lot of above voting works. Nowadays, electronic voting has become an important research. However, there are too many assumptions and institutions which are often added in this research area. It might become to be unpractical when this voting research is applied to real society. Hence, we thought that blockchain might be a good solution for electronic voting research.

This paper presents an empirical analysis of Steemit, a key representative of the emerging incentivized social media platforms over Blockchains, to understand and evaluate the actual level of decentralization and the practical effects of cryptocurrency-driven reward system in these modern social media platforms. Similar to Bitcoin, Steemit is operated by a decentralized community, where 21 members are periodically elected to cooperatively operate the platform through the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. Our study performed on 539 million operations performed by 1.12 million Steemit users during the period 2016/03 to 2018/08 reveals that the actual level of decentralization in Steemit is far lower than the ideal level, indicating that the DPoS consensus protocol may not be a desirable approach for establishing a highly decentralized social media platform. In Steemit, users create contents as posts which get curated based on votes from other users. The platform periodically issues cryptocurrency as rewards to creators and curators of popular posts. Although such a reward system is originally driven by the desire to incentivize users to contribute to high-quality contents, our analysis of the underlying cryptocurrency transfer network on the blockchain reveals that more than 16% transfers of cryptocurrency in Steemit are sent to curators suspected to be bots and also finds the existence of an underlying supply network for the bots, both suggesting a significant misuse of the current reward system in Steemit.

{"title": "Enabling IC Traceability via Blockchain Pegged to Embedded PUF", "date": "05 April 2019", "abstract": "Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain.

Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade \ufb02exibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these \ufb02exibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy \ufb02exibilities without any intermediary or central instance.

As provenance data can be used to check the integrity so, it becomes very important to securely store the provenance data. The stored provenance data should be immutable and also unreachable to adversaries, as it contains private information of users. Cloud users will be assured of their stored data, and Cloud Storage Providers can use this implementation to improve their brand value and performance.

{"title": "Analysis of Arbitrary Content on Blockchain-Based Systems using BigQuery", "date": "16 August 2022", "abstract": " Blockchain-based systems have gained immense popularity as enablers of independent asset transfers and smart contract functionality. They have also, since as early as the first Bitcoin blocks, been used for storing arbitrary contents such as texts and images. On-chain data storage functionality is useful for a variety of legitimate use cases. It does, however, also pose a systematic risk. If abused, for example by posting illegal contents on a public blockchain, data storage functionality can lead to legal consequences for operators and users that need to store and distribute the blockchain, thereby threatening the operational availability of entire blockchain ecosystems. In this paper, we develop and apply a cloud-based approach for quickly discovering and classifying content on public blockchains. Our method can be adapted to different blockchain systems and offers insights into content-related usage patterns and potential cases of abuse.

{"title": "Blockchain as a Platform for Collaborative Ontology Evolution", "date": "13 July 2020", "abstract": "The Semantic Web is an incomplete dream so far, but a revolutionary platform as Blockchain could be the solution to this, not optimal reality. There is still little understanding of, and support for, the evolutionary aspects of ontologies. This is particularly crucial in distributed and collaborative settings such as the Semantic Web, where ontologies naturally co-evolve with their communities of use. In this setting, different organizations and teams collaboratively build a common ground of the domain. In this \"complex\" and dynamic setting, a collaborative change process model requires more powerful engineering, argumentation and negotiation methodologies. Blockchain offers a robust framework for teams' collaboration and ontology versioning globally between an infinite number of teams. Blockchain is an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of evolution events, ontology records, and other records management activities, such as ontology evolution, transaction processing and ontology documenting provenance. In this paper, after briefly summarizing the significant features of Blockchain, we describe blockchain-empowered solutions for building an evolution model based on blockchain technology and its artifacts.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3404709.3404769", "Authors": ["Wa'el Mohsen", "Mostafa Aref", "Khaled ElBahnasy"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450375337", "nombredePage": "235  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Computer Science Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt", "Computer Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt", "Computer Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"], "Conference": "ICFET '20: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Frontiers of Educational Technologies", "doi": "10.1145/3404709", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Nevertheless, the development of blockchain applications is still a challenge. Due to the technological novelty, only a few developers are familiar with blockchain technologies and smart contracts. Others might face a steep learning curve or difficulties to reuse existing code to build blockchain applications. This study proposes a novel approach to tackle these issues, through software product line engineering. To support the approach, a web platform to configure and generate a blockchain application for on-chain traceability is introduced. First, a feature model has been designed to model core features of the chosen domain, based on the existing literature. Then, a configurator has been implemented to support the feature selection phase. Finally, a generator is able to ingest such configurations to generate on-the-shelf blockchain products. The generalizability of the contribution is validated by reproducing on-chain traceability applications proposed in the literature by using the platform. This work provides the first evidence that the implementation of blockchain applications using software product lines enhances the quality of produced applications and reduces the time to market.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3546932.3547001", "Authors": ["Nicolas Six", "Nicolas Herbaut", "Roberto Erick Lopez-Herrejon", "Camille Salinesi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450394437", "nombredePage": "266  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, Paris, France", "Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, Paris, France", "\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, Canada", "Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, Paris, France"], "Conference": "SPLC '22: Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference - Volume A", "doi": "10.1145/3546932", "Total_Citations": "0"},

For example, when users ask for a fast and simple self-service, the industry may need a long and cumbersome process, and sometimes users are not sure whether they have a fair deal according to their contract. With the aim of enhancing the current bicycle insurance system in Denmark, we investigate the local market and develop BlockCycle, which is a blockchain-based bicycle insurance system. The basic idea is that insurance companies transform their insurance products into a smart contract, including the criteria of applying the product and the eligibility of compensating into program logic. When a smart contract is deployed, the immutability can ensure the deal integrity and protect both users and insurance companies from the threat of unauthorized manipulation.

The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption.

{"title": "Electronics Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by Blockchain", "date": "09 May 2019", "abstract": "Electronic systems are ubiquitous today, playing an irreplaceable role in our personal lives, as well as in critical infrastructures such as power grids, satellite communications, and public transportation. In the past few decades, the security of software running on these systems has received significant attention. However, hardware has been assumed to be trustworthy and reliable \u201cby default\u201d without really analyzing the vulnerabilities in the electronics supply chain. With the rapid globalization of the semiconductor industry, it has become challenging to ensure the integrity and security of hardware. In this article, we discuss the integrity concerns associated with a globalized electronics supply chain. More specifically, we divide the supply chain into six distinct entities: IP owner/foundry (OCM), distributor, assembler, integrator, end user, and electronics recycler, and analyze the vulnerabilities and threats associated with each stage. To address the concerns of the supply chain integrity, we propose a blockchain-based certificate authority framework that can be used to manage critical chip information such as electronic chip identification, chip grade, and transaction time. The decentralized nature of the proposed framework can mitigate most threats of the electronics supply chain, such as recycling, remarking, cloning, and overproduction.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571", "Authors": ["Xiaolin Xu", "Fahim Rahman", "Bicky Shakya", "Apostol Vassilev", "Domenic Forte", "Mark Tehranipoor"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1084-4309", "nombredePage": "266  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL", "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL", "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL", "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD", "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL", "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems", "doi": "1557-7309", "Total_Citations": "26"},
{"title": "Logging Multi-Component Supply Chain Production in Blockchain", "date": "08 June 2021", "abstract": "The supply chain is a thriving industry where numerous parties have different interests. Subsequently, the immense volume of data produced is difficult to audit. Some information can be lost or intentionally distorted in the process. Blockchain as an open, public, borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant architecture can significantly complement supply chains. A new supply chain architecture is proposed in this work, where the tokenized directed acyclic hypergraph (DAG) represents real-world production processes. An anti-aerosol respirator manufacturing is used as an illustration example. By tokenizing all parts of multi-component products, supply chain data is automatically timestamped and secured. Moreover, the DAG design allows one to trace-back all the elements of the final product to their origin. Blockchain can formally audit the entire supply chain without the need to go from place to place.

The waste management process is very poor, especially when it comes to confirming the correct destination for the delivery of waste. In this work, we are proposing a chain-based approach to waste tracking to enable waste data reporting in a single system. The blockchain is a technology that has already proven itself in the financial sector. It securely records transactions in a large, time-stamped ledger using the proof of work algorithm (PoW), and allows us to write smart contracts on the ethereum network. The application of this technology to the waste sector will enable reliable, transparent and secure recording of all waste movements, thus enabling waste to be traced from source to treatment and disposal.

Then, the task is allocated to the node with the most efficient treatment for maximum benefit. The innovation of this paper is that not only considers the task processing time, but also considers the computing power of each node in the blockchain, and achieves resources that can save the task processing time and make full use of the node computing power.

The characteristics of this virus, such as high transmission power and lack of definitive treatment have caused problems in all aspects of organizational economics. Restrictions that were imposed to deal with the virus affected the global economy. Fear of being exposed to the virus, quarantine and lockdown led to a massive increase in online shopping. However, people\u2019s concern about the health and authenticity of the products offered online and their incompatibility with consumer standards raised concerns about the reliability of the existing e-commerce models. Fraud, counterfeit products, ethical sourcing and product safety are some of the concerns that affected online business acceptance. To address these challenges, we examine the use of a blockchain-based e-commerce approach to guarantee authenticity through blockchains trace and trace capabilities. In this approach, we evaluate the profit gains achieved through addressing consumer concerns on safety and authenticity. To examine these benefits, we use a game theory leader-follower approach. We evaluate the profitability of e-commerce in three scenarios, including when non of seller and e-commerce website use blockchain, only when the seller uses the blockchain and when both the seller and the e-commerce websites use blockchain. The evaluation results show that the situation in which both the seller and the website use blockchain has the highest profitability for the seller due to the maximum reduction of customer concerns.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3508072.3508090", "Authors": ["Elnaz Rabieinejad", "Abbas Yazdinejad", "Tahereh Hasani", "Mohammad Hammoudeh"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387347", "nombredePage": "847  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Cyber Science Lab, University of Guelph, Canada", "Cyber Science Lab, University of Guelph, Canada", "Lang School of Business and Economics, University of Guelph, Canada", "Department of Computing and Mathematics, Manchester Metropolitan University, United Kingdom"], "Conference": "ICFNDS 2021: The 5th International Conference on Future Networks & Distributed Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3508072", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Although many academic communities were initially slow to grasp the technology's numerous potential implications, meanwhile a substantial amount of research is dedicated to investigating the development and impact of blockchain and related technologies. As undertaken, most research projects take a specific homogenous perspective, such as a technical or business viewpoint. To date, blockchain research studies are largely missing a bridge between and across academic disciplines. Given the manifold implications of blockchain technology, a fruitful crossdisciplinary exchange is therefore needed. In this paper, we bring together researchers with varying expertise to provide a vision into what may be next in terms of concepts, applications, and research agendas. We consider business, economic, societal, legal, technical, and philosophical viewpoints and propose multiple research questions as well as hypotheses arising from these diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, we challenge various academic communities to tackle some of the most crucial issues of current blockchain research and to develop a solid foundation for future exploration.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3447934.3447938", "Authors": ["Horst Treiblmaier", "Melanie Swan", "Primavera de Filippi", "Mary Lacity", "Thomas Hardjono", "Henry Kim"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "0095-0033", "nombredePage": "115  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Modul University Vienna", "Purdue University", "National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) Harvard University", "University of Arkansas", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "York University"], "Conference": "ACM SIGMIS Database: the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems", "doi": "1532-0936", "Total_Citations": "7"},

Network operators try to apply different network optimization technologies, based on link state information such as link bandwidth, link delay, to improve the network performance. However, inter-domain network optimization is hard to realize due to the lack of inter-domain link state information while one AS can only gather the link state information inside itself. Obviously, network information sharing among different ASs is necessary. Supporting for \"trustless disintermediation\", blockchain technology provides capabilities for cooperation among different ASs. We propose a new blockchain-based framework named BGP Link State Sharing Chain(BGP-LSChain), to help different AS owners sharing inter-domain link state. In this framework, we integrate a data verification mechanism and an AS credit rating mechanism to prevent fake data, which are realized by various smart contracts to control data sharing, data verification and credit rating. We implement an BGP-LSChain prototype and conduct experiments to evaluate it. The results show that while helping sharing data among different AS owners, the time cost of BGP-LSChain operations is within a reasonable and acceptable range.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3320154.3320157", "Authors": ["Xuyang Ma", "Du Xu", "Hao Dang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450362689", "nombredePage": "84  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, P.

However, this reliance has proven to be high risk, since Bitcoin and other blockchain-based transactions are not easily reversible. Many of the attacks have shown that the traditional intrusion detection system is not enough to safeguard against all possible attacks, and most importantly, in some cases, it takes a long time to assess the damage. In this paper, we first describe three types of intrusion models in Bitcoin exchanges and propose a detection and mitigation system using blockchain analysis for each. The proposed detection and mitigation system exploit the decentralized and public nature of Bitcoin blockchain to complement the existing traditional intrusion detection system as a fail-safe. The proposed method provides real-time intrusion detection capability that the existing work cannot provide.

In COVID19, there is a need to immediate response and secured way of storing data due to overwhelming patients admitting to the hospitals. Many stakeholders are involved in the health sector, such as patients, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, and hospitals which makes the complete system complex. Security and privacy are the major concern of comprehensive patient-related information accessed by the involved participants. Blockchain technology is capable of ensuring data integrity and privacy with immutable features. The blockchain technology can be implemented in public and private means, but the medical data is sensitive information which cannot be shared to the public. In this paper, the permissioned blockchain is implemented for healthcare sector using Hyperledger Fabric. The Fabric is an open-source platform through which a Smart Contract is developed on the blockchain network. With the help of a smart contract, the secure transaction is performed on the ledger to store the confidential data related to a patient. The data stored in the form of an immutable block ensures the security of health records stored on distributed ledger through a smart contract.

In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure.

{"title": "SkyChain: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Empowered Dynamic Blockchain Sharding System", "date": "17 August 2020", "abstract": "To overcome the limitations on the scalability of current blockchain systems, sharding is widely considered as a promising solution that divides the network into multiple disjoint groups processing transactions in parallel to improve throughput while decreasing the overhead of communication, computation, and storage. However, most existing blockchain sharding systems adopt a static sharding policy that cannot efficiently deal with the dynamic environment in the blockchain system, i.e., joining and leaving of nodes, and malicious attack. This paper presents SkyChain, a novel dynamic sharding-based blockchain framework to achieve a good balance between performance and security without compromising scalability under the dynamic environment. We first propose an adaptive ledger protocol to guarantee that the ledgers can merge or split efficiently based on the dynamic sharding policy. Then, to optimize the sharding policy under dynamic environment with high dimensional system states, a deep reinforcement learning-based sharding approach has been proposed, the goals of which include: 1) building a framework to evaluate the blockchain sharding systems from the aspects of performance and security; 2) adjusting the re-sharding interval, shard number and block size to maintain a long-term balance of the system\u2019s performance and security.

In the era of big data, countless machines and equipment are generating data all the time, which can be used for scientific research, commodity production, and improving the efficiency of industrial development. Since the Internet of Things (IoT) connects all the smart machines together, ensuring data integrity is of great significance. How to ensure and detect the data integrity of the IoT is a topic of concern. This paper designs and implements a distributed blockchain data simulation system for data integrity assurance and detection in the context of IIoT applications. A method for assuring and detecting the integrity of IoT data is presented. A complete simulation system of IoT data based on blockchain is designed and implemented.

In addition, most frameworks use a centralized architecture to update a potentially large number of devices increasing the threat landscape. An alternative solution, that relies on a blockchain framework with smart contracts, is proposed in this paper to protect the integrity of the firmware update process. The proposed system is suitable for use in smart cities or scenarios with a large number of devices and service providers where nodes are authenticated, communications protected, and update conditions specified and enforced through smart contracts. A proof--of--concept system was implemented and tested using an open--source blockchain framework and a WiFi--capabable ESP8266--based board.

However, as everything personal is connected, security and privacy becomes a major challenge. Blockchain-based IoT can provide a completely trusted and transparent environment with its tamper-resistant data structure, timestamp, data encryption and distributed consensus. Since cryptocurrency is the first application of blockchains, most blockchain mechanisms like Ethereum provides token-based peer-to-peer payment system that allows payment using a custom currency which enables IoT devices to pay or receive token without a third-party inclusion. In this paper we proposed to apply blockchain mechanism to education/discipline of children at home by through token-based parental control in which parent can encourage good behaviors and discourage bad behaviors of children via tokens transferred via blockchain network. Current parental control is implemented in operating systems of smartphones that only prohibits the abuse of smartphone games or inappropriate web sites. However, this token-based parental control pay tokens to children with good behaviors that allow them to play or watch the proper contents as their rewards. Devices at home like television and computer are connected to the blockchain and accessible only when the user have a sufficient amount of tokens. Children are given incentives in term of token by their parents if they do their homework properly or help their parents. Besides that, smart contract feature in Ethereum allows application to be programmed in a blockchain enables monitoring the activities of children through blockchain.

The trend calls for a realistic testing and evalua- tion platform for blockchain applications and systems. We present Minichain, a container-based emulator that allows testing proof- of-work-based blockchains on a commodity computer. Minichain contains a realistic and configurable network environment, which is missing in today's blockchain testbeds. This unique feature enables us to evaluate the impact of network events (e.g., cyber-attacks) and conditions (e.g., congested or failed links) on blockchain appli- cations.

More recently, there has been renewed interest in finding a solution to the issues pertaining to privacy of health records and how these records can be easily accessed by different healthcare providers in healthcare-service delivery. Thus, such records comprise an individual's health history and other information that facilitates healthcare decisions. Furthermore, easy access to a patient's health information is an important aspect of health-service delivery that must be regulated and monitored because of the sensitivity of the information. Current approaches adopted in many hospitals face challenges of missing files, or records, lack of information sharing between healthcare providers, insecure records and also inaccessibility of patients' health information for healthcare providers that are needed to make informed health decisions. Building from a case study grounded in interviews and document review, we propose a scalable framework that supports the adoption of blockchain technology in addressing the issues of privacy, information sharing, and record keeping in the health sector.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3326365.3326405", "Authors": ["Irene Azogu", "Alex Norta", "Ingrid Papper", "Justin Longo", "Dirk Draheim"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450366441", "nombredePage": "538  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Regina, Regina, SK, Canada", "Blockchain Technology Group, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia", "Department of Software Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia", "University of Regina, Regina SK, Canada", "Department of Software Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"], "Conference": "ICEGOV2019: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance", "doi": "10.1145/3326365", "Total_Citations": "8"},

{"title": "BACC: Blockchain-Based Access Control For Cloud Data", "date": "04 February 2020", "abstract": "Controlling the access over the stored data in the cloud is one of the fundamental security requirements, especially with the wide usage of cloud storage servers for nearly most of the enterprise applications. Traditional cloud-based access control solutions are based on a centralized approach (i.e. a cloud server becomes the central authority to control accesses to the data), which makes it difficult to prevent malicious cloud servers from disclosing user\u2019s data; and therefore compromising the privacy of the stored data. Additionally, the centralization of authority can cause a single point of failure. Furthermore, to provide confidentiality, which is one of the essential security requirements, user\u2019s data is encrypted before it is stored on the cloud. Most of the cloud servers store the decryption keys, after they encrypt the data, in their premises. This compromises data privacy. In this paper we propose a new model that addresses the aforementioned issues. To address the centralization problem, we distributed the access control tasks to smart contracts over a decentralized network, i.e. blockchain. To address the latter, we used Shamir secret sharing scheme to manage the encryption keys. Then we introduced a new type of node, called master node, to our blockchain platform, to store the decryption key parts.

In the field of artificial intelligence, model data (i.e. effective feature point data set) will be the key information and will be used frequently. However, these feature point datasets may be megabytes, auspicious, or even terahertz. Then, the performance of big data transaction in blockchain network will be a problem worthy of study. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain big data storage method based on IPFs. This method mainly solves the transaction performance problem of large text data in the blockchain network. The data larger than 100 megabytes are stored in IPFs to obtain the hash certificate of text. The hash code is the only transaction voucher in the blockchain network. It greatly improves the transaction efficiency of blockchain network.

Traditional methods to defeat equivocation rely on trusted hardware or particular assumptions, which may hinder their adoption in practice. The advent of blockchain and decentralized cryptocurrencies provides an auspicious breakthrough paradigm to resolve the problem above. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution to address contractual equivocation, which supports user-defined fine-grained policy-based equivocation. Specifically, users will be de-incentive if the statements they made breach the predefined access rules. The core of our solution is a newly introduced primitive named Policy-Authentication-Preventing Signature (PoAPS), which combined with a deposit mechanism allows a signer to make conflict statements corresponding to a policy to be penalized. We present a generic construction of PoAPS based on Policy-Based Verifiable Secret Sharing (PBVSS) and demonstrate its practicality via a concrete implementation in the blockchain.

Over the years, informal conventions or \"norms\" for transaction ordering have, however, emerged via the use of shared software by miners, e.g., the GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core. Today, a widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions based on their offered \"transaction fee-per-byte.\" Bitcoin users are, consequently, encouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the commitment of their transactions, particularly during periods of congestion. In this paper, we audit the Bitcoin blockchain and present statistically significant evidence of mining pools deviating from the norms to accelerate the commitment of transactions for which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii) received dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels. As blockchains are increasingly being used as a record-keeping substrate for a variety of decentralized (financial technology) systems, our findings call for an urgent discussion on defining neutrality norms that miners must adhere to when ordering transactions in the chains.

{"title": "An Incentive-based Mechanism for Volunteer Computing Using Blockchain", "date": "22 July 2021", "abstract": "The rise of fast communication media both at the core and at the edge has resulted in unprecedented numbers of sophisticated and intelligent wireless IoT devices. Tactile Internet has enabled the interaction between humans and machines within their environment to achieve revolutionized solutions both on the move and in real-time. Many applications such as intelligent autonomous self-driving, smart agriculture and industrial solutions, and self-learning multimedia content filtering and sharing have become attainable through cooperative, distributed, and decentralized systems, namely, volunteer computing. This article introduces a blockchain-enabled resource sharing and service composition solution through volunteer computing. Device resource, computing, and intelligence capabilities are advertised in the environment to be made discoverable and available for sharing with the aid of blockchain technology. Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given to resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative resource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated with the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure communication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer computing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and reliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning technique. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve high reward distribution, increased number of blockchain formations, reduced delays, and balanced resource usage among participants, under the premise of high IoT device availability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3419104", "Authors": ["Ismaeel Al Ridhawi", "Moayad Aloqaily", "Yaser Jararweh"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1533-5399", "nombredePage": "520  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Kuwait College of Science and Technology, Kuwait", "0000-0001-5822-2763", "Al Ain University, UAE", "0000-0003-2443-7234", "Jordan University of Science and Technology, Jordan", "0000-0002-4403-3846"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Internet Technology", "doi": "1557-6051", "Total_Citations": "1"},

{"title": "Proving Multimedia Integrity using Sanitizable Signatures Recorded on Blockchain", "date": "02 July 2019", "abstract": "While significant advancements have been made in the field of multimedia forensics to detect altered content, existing techniques mostly focus on enabling the content recipient to verify the content integrity without any inputs from the content creator. In many application scenarios, the creator has a strong incentive to establish the provenance and integrity of the multimedia data created and released by him. Hence, there is a strong need for mechanisms that allow the content creator to prove the authenticity of the released content. Since blockchain technology provides an immutable distributed database, it is an ideal solution for reliably time-stamping content with its creation time and storing an irrefutable signature of the content at the time of its creation. However, a simple digital signature scheme does not allow modification of the content after the initial commitment. Authorized multimedia content alteration by its creator is often necessary (e.g., redaction of faces to protect the privacy of individuals in a video, redaction of sensitive fields in a text document) before the content is distributed. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel sanitizable signature scheme that enables the content creator to prove the integrity of the redacted content, while preventing the recipients from reconstructing the redacted segments based on the published commitment, and (ii) a blockchain-based solution for securely managing the sanitizable signature. The proposed solution employs a robust hashing scheme using chameleon hash function and Merkle tree to generate the initial signature, which is stored on the blockchain. The auxiliary data required for the integrity verification step is retained by the content creator and only a signature of this auxiliary data is stored on the blockchain. Any modifications to the multimedia content requires only updating the signature of the auxiliary data, which is securely recorded on the blockchain. We demonstrate that the proposed approach enables verification of integrity of redacted multimedia content without compromising the content privacy requirements.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3335203.3335729", "Authors": ["Karthik Nandakumar", "Nalini Ratha", "Sharathchandra Pankanti"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450368216", "nombredePage": "249  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["IBM Research, Singapore, Singapore", "IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA", "IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA"], "Conference": "IH&MMSec'19: Proceedings of the ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security", "doi": "10.1145/3335203", "Total_Citations": "5"},

{"title": "Do the Rich Get Richer? Fairness Analysis for Blockchain Incentives", "date": "18 June 2021", "abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the most widely adopted incentive model in current blockchain systems, which unfortunately is energy inefficient. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is then proposed to tackle the energy issue. The rich-get-richer concern of PoS has been heavily debated in the blockchain community. The debate is centered around the argument that whether rich miners possessing more stakes will obtain higher staking rewards and further increase their potential income in the future. In this paper, we define two types of fairness, i.e., expectational fairness and robust fairness, that are useful for answering this question. In particular, expectational fairness illustrates that the expected income of a miner is proportional to her initial investment, indicating that the expected return on investment is a constant. To better capture the uncertainty of mining outcomes, robust fairness is proposed to characterize whether the return on investment concentrates to a constant with high probability as time evolves. Our analysis shows that the classical PoW mechanism can always preserve both types of fairness as long as the mining game runs for a sufficiently long time. Furthermore, we observe that current PoS blockchains implement various incentive models and discuss three representatives, namely ML-PoS, SL-PoS and C-PoS. We find that (i) ML-PoS (e.g., Qtum and Blackcoin) preserves expectational fairness but may not achieve robust fairness, (ii) SL-PoS (e.g., NXT) does not protect any type of fairness, and (iii) C-PoS (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) outperforms ML-PoS in terms of robust fairness while still maintaining expectational fairness.

The Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) is widely used in blockchains, e.g., Libra/Diem; however, no suitable threshold solution exists. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a threshold EdDSA that allows n parties to generate keys in a decentralized and distributed manner. Any t + 1-of-n parties can generate standard EdDSA signatures. This scheme supports an arbitrary threshold (t, n) and has been proven to be secure against at most t malicious adversaries. The theoretical analysis (computation complexity and communication footprints) and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs efficiently on cloud servers and embedded devices. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is integrated with Tendermint, a blockchain framework that uses EdDSA, to generate keys and sign transactions in a decentralized manner, which indicates that this scheme is compatible with blockchains for supporting DeFi applications.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3545948.3545977", "Authors": ["Yang Shi", "Junqing Liang", "Mianhong Li", "Tianchen Ma", "Guodong Ye", "Jiangfeng Li", "Qinpei Zhao"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450397049", "nombredePage": "536  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Tongji University, China", "Tongji University, China", "Tongji University, China", "Tongji University, China", "Guangdong Ocean University, China", "Tongji University, China", "Tongji University, China"], "Conference": "RAID '22: Proceedings of the 25th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses", "doi": "10.1145/3545948", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Integrating blockchain technology into the accounting information system can not only break the development restrictions of the accounting information system, but also realize the sharing of resource information among enterprises in the industry, including existing customers and suppliers. However, due to the openness and transparency of blockchain technology, there have been speculations similar to the free-rider problem among corporate accounting entities. The author uses game theory to analyze speculative behavior among accounting entities based on blockchain technology. Through analyzing the prisoner's dilemma, the selection tendency of the interests represented by each node on the blockchain is obtained after the game. Based on the boxed pig game analysis, it is concluded that under the influence of factors such as optimal prices, sales prices, negotiation costs, and production costs, larger companies in the same industry will take the initiative to negotiate prices with customers. By contrast, under the influence of factors such as optimal prices, purchase prices, and negotiation costs, larger companies in the same industry will first negotiate prices with suppliers.

Current schemes rely on the open network architecture which has security vulnerabilities, privacy leaks, vulnerability to various attacks and other security risks. We propose an end-to-end succinct non-interactive offline authentication scheme based on blockchain technology(BC-SNOA). Using blockchain techniques such as anonymity, ellipticcurve cryptography, workload consensus, and privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proof, the BC-SNOA implements one-time pad to improve confidentiality, offline authentication to avoid network remote intrusions and the risk of network services interruptions. It is difficult to replicate and crack because of the in chip calculation of workloads and mathematical problems.

Harmful greenhouse gases, especially CO2, emitted from industrial processes executed by developed countries were identified as the primary reason behind climate change. The world recognized the risk of excessive CO2 emissions, therefore, the United Nations established the Kyoto protocol which aims at reducing the release of CO2 by monetizing its emissions. To achieve its goal, the Kyoto protocol established a carbon emission trading scheme to distribute and trade CO2 allowances among and between emitting participants. However, the carbon emission trading scheme fell short of its goal due to lack of integrity, governance, high intermediary cost and other security and technical issues revealing the need for a solution to elevate the scheme's operations. Meanwhile, blockchian emerged as a revolutionary way to operate business models due to its decentralization, security, traceability, immutability, and privacy. This study proposes an efficient and smart carbon emission trading system utilizing blockchain and smart contract. Our paper proposes a carbon emission trading system using Ethereum blockchain smart contract to automate trading Kyoto units between entities and reduce operations cost. The proposed system performs buyers registration and Kyoto units trading using Ether cryptocurrency for payment without intermediary but rather through smart contract and blockchain.

It is deemed the key to ensuring the built-in integrity of information and security of immutability by design in the peer-to-peer network (P2P) of mobile devices. In a permissioned blockchain, the authority of the system has control over the identities of its users. Such information can allow an ill-intentioned authority to map identities with their spatiotemporal data, which undermines the location privacy of a mobile user. In this paper, we study the location privacy preservation problem in the context of permissioned blockchain-based IoT systems under three conditions. First, the authority of the blockchain holds the public and private key distribution task in the system. Second, there exists a spatiotemporal correlation between consecutive location-based transactions. Third, users communicate with each other through short-range communication technologies such that it constitutes a proof of location (PoL) on their actual locations. We show that, in a permissioned blockchain with an authority and a presence of a PoL, existing approaches cannot be applied using a plug-and-play approach to protect location privacy.

{"title": "A Secure File Sharing System Based on IPFS and Blockchain", "date": "25 August 2020", "abstract": "There is a great interest in many approaches towards blockchain in providing a solution to record transactions in a decentralized way. However, there are some limitations when storing large files or documents on the blockchain. In order to meet the requirements of storing relatively large data, a decentralized storage medium is produced. IPFS is a distributed file system which is content-addressable. It works very similar to the blockchain network. There are some attempts which take advantage of the blockchain concept and IPFS to design new approaches. Unfortunately, there are some inefficiencies in sharing data using the combination of IPFS and blockchain. In this paper, we proposed a secure file sharing system that brings a distributed access control and group key management by the adoption of the IPFS proxy. The IPFS proxy which plays an important role in the design is adopted to take responsibility for the control policies. The combination of the IPFS server and the blockchain network with the adoption of the IPFS proxy make a secure file sharing system which the members on the system can create new groups or join different groups by their own choice. Although there is no access control mechanism in IPFS server and blockchain network, the secure file sharing system manages the access control policies. The members access files only belong to the group they authorized.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3409934.3409948", "Authors": ["Hsiao-Shan Huang", "Tian-Sheuan Chang", "Jhih-Yi Wu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377706", "nombredePage": "184  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd.

Existing works introduce the blockchain technology to transfer the responsibility of key management from the trusted center in the traditional key management strategy to the devices, thus eliminating the trust crisis caused by excessive dependence on third parties. However, the lightweight implementation of IoT devices limits the ability to resist side channel attacks, causing the private key to be exposed and subject to masquerading attacks. Accordingly, we strengthen the original blockchain based key management scheme to defend against key exposure attack. On the one hand, we introduce two hash functions to bind transactions in the blockchain to legitimate users. On the other hand, we design a secure key exchange protocol for identifying and exchanging access keys between legitimate users.

{"title": "SDGchain: When Service Dependency Graph Meets Blockchain to Enhance Privacy", "date": "26 April 2021", "abstract": "Nowadays, the number of services is increasing which allows users to perform their tasks easily. A huge amount of data is published regularly where the personal data takes the lion's share. In fact, personal data protection remains a big issue as far as how the service provider collected the data and for what purpose. Therefore, the privacy of the data owner has to be preserved by putting a strategy to control the data usage by the services. The concept of inter services privacy has been marginalized in the previous privacy preserving works. This paper proposes SDGchain, a secure and privacy-preserving decentralized model that uses secure service dependency graph (SDG) combined with permissioned blockchain Hyperledger fabric, which cooperates with an off-chain storage. In our design the SDG is used to control inter services interactions by building dependencies, measuring the level of trust, calculating the quality of service to ensure the privacy preservation of the service using blockchain to support authentication, access control and the logging operations for immutable and auditable history.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3445970.3451157", "Authors": ["Rofaida Khemaissia", "Makhlouf Derdour", "Ala Djeddai", "Mohamed Amine Ferrag"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper"], "ISBN": "9781450383202", "nombredePage": "88  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Larbi Tebessi University, Tebessa, Algeria", "Larbi Ben M'Hidi University, Oum El Bouaghi, Algeria", "Larbi Tebessi University, Tebessa, Algeria", "8 Mai 1945 University, Guelma, Algeria"], "Conference": "IWSPA '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy Analytics", "doi": "10.1145/3445970", "Total_Citations": "0"},

In this talk, I will present an absurdly simple consensus protocol called Streamlet. The entire protocol is: every epoch, a leader proposes a block extending the longest chain it has seen so far. Everyone votes for (i.e., signs) the first block proposed by the leader if it extends from one of the longest notarized chains they have seen so far. When a block collects votes from 2/3 of the nodes, it becomes notarized. Notarized does not mean final. Finality is decided with the following rule: for any chain in which all blocks are notarized and moreover, the last three blocks have consecutive epoch numbers, the entire chain except the first block is final. Streamlet is inspired by the community's past five years of work on consensus motivated by decentralized blockchains. To the best of our knowledge, it is the simplest embodiment known thus far, and it subsumes classical landmark protocols such as PBFT/Paxos and their numerous variants. It is a great fit for pedagogy. Streamlet has been incorporated into courses at universities such as Stanford and CMU.

However, the current authorization mechanism based on blockchain is not perfect, which is easy to cause the user's identity attributes to be leaked, and not conducive to protecting the privacy of users. In order to improve the authorization mechanism based on the blockchain and protect the user's privacy to the greatest extent during the authorization process, we proposed a privacy-protecting authorization system based on blockchain and zk-SNARK. First of all, SP can authorize users through the blockchain smart contract. Second, in the authorization process, we introduced zk-SNARK. Using the zero-knowledge property of zk-SNARK, the SP can still authorize the users without knowing the identity attribute value of the users. Therefore, the proposed system can better protect the users' attribute privacy. Finally, we analyze the security of the proposed system, and the results show that it is computationally infeasible for an attacker to attack the system.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3444370.3444610", "Authors": ["Qinan Li", "Zhihao Xue"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387828", "nombredePage": "597  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou Gansu China", "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou Gansu China"], "Conference": "CIAT 2020: Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Cyberspace Innovation of Advanced Technologies", "doi": "10.1145/3444370", "Total_Citations": "1"},
{"title": "Blockchain-based Certificateless Identity Management Mechanism in Cloud-native Environments", "date": "07 January 2022", "abstract": "With the widespread development of cloud-native technologies, the security of cloud-native system has gradually attracted attention. Cloud-native uses PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) to provide an important guarantee for cloud-native network security, however the heavy certificate management gradually makes the PKI mechanism be a bottleneck for cloud-native systems. In constract with PKI, the certificateless public key mechanism has many advantages such as lightness, which is very suitable for authentication in cloud-native environment. However, before introducing the certificateless public key mechanism into the cloud-native environment, the first problem that must be solved is the identity management. This paper proposes a blockchain-based certificateless identity management (BCL-IM) mechanism for cloud-native environment, which uses blockchain as a trust endorsement for service identity and service public key distribution records, and ensures the timeliness of identity management by blockchain node notification. In addition, a communication disconnect mechanism is also proposed and the usage scenarios of this mechanism are analyzed to ensure the data security. Finally, we give security analysis and performance evaluation to show that our scheme satisfies the requirements for secure service-to-service communication in cloud-native environments based on the certificateless public key mechanism.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3491396.3506537", "Authors": ["Xuetao Li", "Jingjian Zhang", "Xiaotong Niu", "Jianfeng Guan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450391603", "nombredePage": "241  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computer Science (National Pilot Software Engineering School), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "School of Computer Science (National Pilot Software Engineering School), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "School of Computer Science (National Pilot Software Engineering School), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "School of Computer Science (National Pilot Software Engineering School), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"], "Conference": "ACM ICEA '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications", "doi": "10.1145/3491396", "Total_Citations": "0"},

A Survey", "date": "01 June 2022", "abstract": "In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals.

{"title": "Blockchain Voting and its effects on Election Transparency and Voter Confidence", "date": "07 June 2017", "abstract": "Public elections are one of the basis upon which representative democracy is built. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that governments and organizations are able to successfully hold non-fraudulent representative elections. Several methods are employed in order to allow citizens to cast their votes, such as Ballot-based voting, purely electronic methods, and Electronic Voting Machines, among others. However, we argue that current methods, specially those based on electronic platforms, provide unsatisfactory levels of transparency to voters, thus harming the trust voters have that the vote they cast was the same one counted by election officials, a problem known as voter confidence. Instead of stepping back to traditional and inefficient offline strategies, we suggest the modernization of State structures by the use of emerging technologies. In this research, we explore the possibility of using Blockchain technology to help in solving those transparency and confidence problems. First, we give an overview of Blockchain itself and other uses focused on societal problems and their respective analysis. We then analyze how the adoption of Blockchain into a digital government repertoire can contribute to common e-voting issues and also promote elections transparency, increase auditability, enhance voter confidence and strengthen democracy.

We report on experiences from connecting the syslog functionality of a Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 programmable logic controller to the public Ethereum blockchain network.

These requirements consist of a single set of rules that have binding legal status and should be enforced in all EU member states. In light of these requirements, we propose in this paper the use of a blockchain-based approach to support data accountability and provenance tracking. Our approach relies on the use of publicly auditable contracts deployed in a blockchain that increase the transparency with respect to the access and usage of data. We identify and discuss three models for our approach with different granularity and scalability requirements where contracts can be used to encode data usage policies and provenance tracking information in a privacy-friendly way. From these three models we designed, implemented, and evaluated a model where contracts are deployed by data subjects for each data controller, and a model where subjects join contracts deployed by data controllers in case they accept the data handling conditions.

SG aims to provide all required and advanced features to overcome the issues of the existing power grid and to fulfill the rapidly growing demands of power generation, transmission, distribution, and monitoring energy consumption. However, SG has been facing various challenges to ensure the nature of every transaction, transaction verification, and recording in the power supply chain, especially in the context of a large scale IoT(Internet of things) network. Another issue is maintaining the privacy of every transaction, as well as the privacy of participating entities in the power supply chain. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based proof-of-concept solution to manage every transaction that occurs in an IoT-aided smart grid system. Our solution, IoT-aided smart grid system with blockchain, provides an immutable transaction record, which is always shared and transparent to each participant of the system. Transactions are carried through IoT objects connected in a smart grid, and are recorded, verified, and validated on a blockchain immutable ledger. Furthermore, to verify and maintain the privacy of participants, cryptographic pseudonyms are used by each participant to interact with the SG supply chain, without revealing personal identities and important private information of the participants to malicious entities in the system.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3412841.3441949", "Authors": ["Aamir Shahzad", "Kaiwen Zhang", "Abdelouahed Gherbi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450381048", "nombredePage": "2075  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada", "\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada", "\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"], "Conference": "SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3412841", "Total_Citations": "1"},

This is due to fact that the communicating entities in the network mostly uses unsecured communication channel to exchange critical surveillance data. Authentication thus plays a crucial role in the 5G-enabled UAV network, providing a range of security services such as credential privacy, Session-Key (SK) security, and secure mutual authentication. However, transparency, anonymity, traceability and centralized control are few major security requirements that cannot be fulfilled by the traditional authentication schemes. One of the upcoming technologies that can provide a solution for present centralized 5G-enabled UAV network is blockchain-based authentication scheme. Motivated from aforementioned discussion, this paper presents a Permissioned Blockchain empowered Secure Authentication and Key Agreement framework in 5G-enabled UAVs. In this framework, first an authentication phase between UAV-to-UAV, UAV-to-Edge Server (ES) and Edge-to-Cloud Server (CS) supporting mutual authentication and key agreement is proposed. The authenticated surveillance data collected from UAV is used by the peer-to-peer CS for transaction verification, block creation and addition using smart contract-based consensus mechanism.

While encouraging, this is leading to the emergence of new data, asset and process silos limiting the potential value these networks bring to the broader ecosystem. Mechanisms for enabling network interoperability help preserve the benefits of independent sovereign networks, while allowing for the transfer or sharing of data, assets and processes across network boundaries. However, a naive approach to interoperability based on traditional point-to-point integration is insufficient for preserving the underlying trust decentralized networks provide. In this paper, we lay the foundation for an approach to interoperability based on a communication protocol that derives trust from the underlying network consensus protocol. We present an architecture and a set of building blocks that can be adapted for use in a range of network implementations and demonstrate a proof-of-concept for trusted data-sharing between two independent trade finance and supply-chain networks, each running on Hyperledger Fabric.

{"title": "A Byzantine Fault Tolerant Storage for Permissioned Blockchain", "date": "18 June 2021", "abstract": "The full-replication data storage mechanism, as commonly utilized in existing blockchains, suffers from poor scalability, since it requires every node to preserve a complete copy of the whole block data locally to tolerant potential Byzantine failures.

However, refurbishing medical equipment is not a straightforward process, as there exist many challenges associated to their proper re-positioning into the market. In this paper the use of blockchain technology is proposed as a viable solution for establishing sound refurbishing channels for medical equipment while considering relevant regulatory, security and operational prerequisites. In particular, we propose a highly robust traceability mechanism for medical equipment refurbishing activities based on blockchain and smart contracts. Our approach offers multiple and disparate stakeholders (device manufacturers, hospitals, refurbishers, retailers etc.) to share critical RL information in a timely, verifiable and secure fashion. The system provides forensics-by-design functionalities and safeguards the chain-of-custody for all the refurbishing processes taking place.

However, for the harsh environment with network fluctuations and potential attacks, traditional task offloading decision-making schemes cannot meet the requirements of real-time and security. For this reason, we propose a novel task offloading decision framework to cope with the special requirements of the environment. This framework uses a task offloading decision model based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and is located on the user side to reduce the impact of network fluctuations. To improve the efficiency and security of the model in harsh edge computing environments, we adopt federated learning and introduce the blockchain into the process of parameter upload and decentralization of federated learning.

Especially in the case of business transactions, data communication security (such as for banking transaction, contract) is necessary. Sony, et al. [1] proposed a method for securing a contract by introducing ECDSA for signing a contract based on blockchain. However, Sony's method requires high time complexity and not resistant against quantum computing attacks. Therefore, this research proposed a method to reduce the time complexity and resistant against quantum computing attack. To overcome the quantum attack and reduce the time complexity of digital signing based on blockchain, McElliece Cryptosystem and digital signature based on Niederreiter are introduced for signing the contract. Since McElliece Cryptosystem and Niederreiter based signature uses scalar multiplication then the processing time is less than ECDSA. Based on the experiment result, it is proven that the execution time for signing process using the proposed method may reach up to 51.1% less than signing execution time of Sony's method, and for verification process up to 77.8% less than verification execution time of Sony's method.

{"title": "A Clicks-and-Mortar Information Exchange Mechanism Based on Blockchain Technology", "date": "26 June 2019", "abstract": "Nowadays, e-commerce has made its official way into the clicks-and-mortar era. The advantage of the clicks-and-mortar strategy is that it enjoys logistics support from the \"mortar\" counterpart, which complements any operational inadequacy on the side of the virtual website -- the \"clicks\" counterpart. In the future, the clicks-and-mortar model can facilitate the merging of different businesses and strategic partnerships that will diversify sales channels as well as client sources. When an Internet brand attempts to establish a physical distribution channel, it must take into consideration three aspects in which physical channels are inferior to the virtual marketplace: (1) issues of lease costs, (2) issues of merchandise inventory, and (3) issues of product profit. Among all, the most concerning issue is the inability to keep real-time tabs of sales conditions, which can lead to slow-moving inventory sitting on shelves of physical stores, accumulating dead stocks. The price of a merchandise may differ at a physical store and at the virtual marketplace; moreover, the two channels have different schedules and paces in updating products and hosting sales events, creating an information discrepancy between the physical store and the virtual store, which leads to price competition and client source competition between the physical store and the virtual store.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3326467.3326470", "Authors": ["Hsin-Te Wu", "Jun-Wei Zhan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450361903", "nombredePage": "231  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Penghu County, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Penghu County, Taiwan"], "Conference": "WIMS2019: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics", "doi": "10.1145/3326467", "Total_Citations": "0"},

The execution of smart contracts on public blockchains can be invoked by any user with a transaction, although in many scenarios there would be the need for restricting the right of executing smart contracts only to a restricted set of users. To help deal with this issue, this paper proposes a system based on a popular access control framework called RT, Role-based Trust Management, to regulate smart contracts execution rights. The proposed system, called L2DART (Layer 2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust management), implements the RT framework on a public blockchain, and it is designed as a layer-2 technology that involves both on-chain and off-chain functionalities to reduce the blockchain costs while keeping blockchain auditability, i.e., immutability and transparency. The on-chain costs of L2DART have been evaluated on Ethereum and compared with a previous solution implementing on-chain all the functionalities. The results show that the on-chain costs of L2DART are relatively low, making the system deployable in real-world scenarios.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3561386", "Authors": ["Andrea De Salve", "Luca Franceschi", "Andrea Lisi", "Paolo Mori", "Laura Ricci"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1533-5399", "nombredePage": null, "AuthorsFormation": ["Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - ISASI, Italy", "University of Pisa, Italy", "University of Pisa, Italy and Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - IIT, Italy", "Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - IIT, Italy", "University of Pisa, Italy"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Internet Technology", "doi": "1557-6051", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Current estimates commonly reach the tens of billions for the number of connected 'things'. The heterogeneous capabilities of these devices serve as a motivation for resource sharing among them. However, for effective resource sharing, it is essential that trust be retained in the multitude of pervasive and diverse IoT devices. Remote attestation is a well-known technique used to build such trust. Thus, this paper proposes a blockchain based remote attestation protocol to establish trust between IoT devices. The blockchain offers a secure framework for device registration while the attestation is based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF).

However, the digital documents have some security issues. For example, when a user who has the permission behaves maliciously for his/her benefit, the digital document can be easily falsified. In this paper, we propose a decentralized document management system (DDMS) to improve security of a digital document. DDMS first distributes access permission to multiple users for higher security of the document. To do this, DDMS encrypts a document via a symmetric key and splits the key via a Shamir's secret sharing scheme. And, DDMS manages each split keys using blockchian and reconstructs the complete symmetric key when the document is retrieved via a devised smart contract. We implement DDMS based on Ethereum blockchain. The experimental results show that the proposed DDMS can provide higher security with a reasonable performance overhead compared with other three types of DMSs.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3412841.3442077", "Authors": ["Jongbeen Han", "Heemin Kim", "Hyeonsang Eom", "Yongseok Son"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["poster"], "ISBN": "9781450381048", "nombredePage": "2075  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea", "Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea", "Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea", "Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"], "Conference": "SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3412841", "Total_Citations": "1"},

Development of this technology has significantly changed the global cyberspace. Governments of all the world countries have to face the need to regulate this sphere, but as the blockchain technology is characterized by unprecedented abilities, most states remain at least alert to it. In this context, the issues of studying international experience in legal regulation of the blockchain technology become relevant for research. The goal of this study is to consider experience of different countries and international organizations in regulation of the blockchain technology. The paper presents the results of a study of the attitude towards blockchain technologies and their application by various international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Eurasian Economic Union.The authors have developed a comprehensive methodology for revealing best practices of legal regulation of the blackchain technology use based on experience of the leading international organizations engaged in evaluation of the current practices of legal regulation in selected fields of economy. This methodology consists of four stages and is carried out in five directions: a general assessment of the effectiveness of legal norms, industry specificity, solving problems of using blockchain, assessing the risks of using blockchain, calculating the dynamics of indicators. Application of this methodology made it possible to evaluate the available experience of 47 countries and reveal 12 leaders of legal regulation of the blockchain technology. The obtained results may be used by concerned researchers from different countries for studying the world experience and building, on this basis, their own legal frameworks for spreading contemporary financial technologies.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3444465.3444475", "Authors": ["Ekaterina Kharitonova", "Natalia Kharitonova", "Valentina Pulyaeva", "Venera Shaidullina"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450388313", "nombredePage": "447  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia", "Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia", "Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia", "Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia"], "Conference": "SPBPU IDE '20: Proceedings of the 2nd International Scientific Conference on Innovations in Digital Economy", "doi": "10.1145/3444465", "Total_Citations": "2"},

At the moment, such points can be collected and spent only within the same shop (or shops from the same consortium), which makes it only interesting for customers visiting that particular store frequently. However, especially with the increase of e-shops, customers easily switch between stores. With this new shopping behaviour, such programs are less attractive and as such become less effective, requiring a more novel approach. One possibility could be to allow customers to collect and spent loyalty points across stores. In fact, this is just one use case of a more general issue. There are multiple cases in which people receive (digital) resources from organizations or other parties and want to use or exchange them across other organizations or parties. In this paper, we propose a generic framework that allows customers to exchange resources across different parties. We propose to implement this framework with a blockchain-based solution, making the customers in full control and awareness of their available resources as well as creating a decentralized, trustable and safe environment.

Due to the nature of tamper-resistance, blockchain can well be used to achieve secure and reliable search without the participation of any third party. For data storage system with frequent updates, unfortunately, the existing blockchain-based search methods do not work. In this paper, we try to solve this problem by proposing a highly efficient search scheme for dynamic updates while still using blockchain to ensure security and reliability. Instead of modifying the original index directly, our updates are implemented by appending new indices when adding new data and maintaining a revocation list when deleting or changing data. Note that, the index tables and revocation list are preserved through dynamic searchable encryption, achieving high efficiency as well as security. Thus, attacker cannot learn if the newly added file contains a keyword that was searched before or not, so it can resist file-rejection attacks.

It is inherently spam resistant by virtue of its design, and does not rely upon processing fees to achieve this goal. We suggest to improve throughput scalability through a dynamic block size adaptive to the network\u2019s hashing power.

A key enabler for MaaS is technology that can provide the means for complex mobility ecosystems to be integrated, while allowing diverse service providers and related stakeholders (e.g. payment management organizations) to perform transactions between each other (for booking, invoicing, payment, etc.) as well as interact with the traveler, acquire and exchange operational data, and process it into information that can be used to support MaaS related business processes. Such an ecosystem can be centrally coordinated when all participants in the value chain have the same understanding of what needs to be delivered and accept to follow a common approach, which can be proprietary, customized and aligned to vendor specific guidelines. As the MaaS ecosystem expands and the coordination of an increasing number of mobility solutions comes into play, the complexity can be such that new decentralized solutions are required. In this work in progress paper we discuss the role of blockchain technology for enabling seamless mobility for MaaS.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3358695.3361844", "Authors": ["Efthimios Bothos", "Babis Magoutas", "Kostantina Arnaoutaki", "Gregoris Mentzas"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450369886", "nombredePage": "326  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["National Technical University of Athens, Greece", "National Technical University of Athens, Greece", "National Technical University of Athens, Greece", "National Technical University of Athens, Greece"], "Conference": "WI '19 Companion: IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence - Companion Volume", "doi": "10.1145/3358695", "Total_Citations": "7"},

{"title": "Blockchain as a Trusted Component in Cloud SLA Verification", "date": "02 December 2019", "abstract": "Migrating an application from local compute resources to commercial cloud resources involves giving up full control of the physical infrastructure, as the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for managing the physical infrastructure, including its security. The reliance of a tenant on a CSP can create a trust issue around whether the CSP is upholding its end of the bargain. CSPs acknowledge this and provide a guarantee through a Service Level Agreement (SLA). SLAs need to be verified for satisfaction of the defined objectives. To avoid raising the trust issue again, such a verification procedure needs to be unbiased and independently achievable by both tenants and CSPs without one relying on the other party. In this paper, we consider an SLA offered by the provider that guarantees the integrity of tenants' data, and propose to verify the SLA using an integrity checking method based on a distributed ledger. Our proposed method allows both CSPs and tenants to perform integrity checking without one party relying on the other. The method uses a blockchain as a distributed ledger to store evidence of data integrity. Assuming the ledger as a secure, trusted source of information, the evidence can be used to resolve conflicts between providers and tenants. In addition, we present a prototype implementation and an experimental evaluation to show the feasibility of our verification method and to measure the time overhead.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3368235.3368872", "Authors": ["Amir Teshome Wonjiga", "Sean Peisert", "Louis Rilling", "Christine Morin"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450370448", "nombredePage": "193  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA, Rennes, France", "CRD, LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA", "DGA, Bruz, France", "Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA, Rennes, France"], "Conference": "UCC '19 Companion: Proceedings of the 12th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion", "doi": "10.1145/3368235", "Total_Citations": "7"},

Blockchain solutions are used to enhance the trustworthiness and eliminate the need for trusted third parties by providing mechanisms to reach consensus in a network of trustless participants. The consensus algorithms employed by blockchain architectures ensure the integrity of the data stored in the blockchain, the resiliency of the network and manage the security of devices. However, current solutions are compute intensive affecting the performance of the network and consuming much energy. In this work, we introduce a consensus algorithm for offering secure distributed consensus among IoT devices without affecting the performance of the network.

This paper discusses how to handle conflict situations affecting a blockchain system. Specifically, we model two real-world conflict scenarios -- the Lazy Miner dilemma and the Impatient Seller dilemma -- by proposing a novel multi-layer framework coupled with a heuristics-based game-theoretic modeling. The multi-layer approach provides a way to include cross-modality integration (human quality factors, such as reliability) and human actions on the blockchain. We design a multi-agent game-theoretic methodology combined with some statistical estimators derived from the heuristics. Our model also includes the concept of homophily, a human-related factor connected to the similarity and frequency of interactions on the multi-layer network. Based on the heuristics, a dynamically evolving measure of weights is further defined such that an agent increases or decreases the link weights to its neighbours according to the experienced payoffs. We show how data mining in blockchain data could be incorporated into a heuristic model which provides parameters for the game-theoretic payoff matrix. Thus, this work represents a platform for simulating the evolutionary dynamics of the agents' behaviors, including also heuristics and homophily on a multi-layer blockchain network.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3369740.3372914", "Authors": ["Alessandro Di Stefano", "Damiano Di Francesco Maesa", "Sajal K.

{"title": "A Security-Enhanced Monitoring System for Northbound Interface in SDN using Blockchain", "date": "04 December 2019", "abstract": "In Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Northbound Interface provides APIs, which allow network applications to communicate with SDN controllers. However, a malicious application can access to SDN controller and perform illegal activities via these APIs. Although some studies proposed AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) systems to protect SDN controllers from malicious applications, their proposed systems also exist several limitations. Attackers can compromise a system, then modify its database or files to gain higher privileges. This system can be taken down because of Single Point of Failure threat. To enhance security for the Northbound interface, we propose a novel system using blockchain, namely BlockAS.

{"title": "Privacy-preserving energy storage sharing with blockchain and secure multi-party computation", "date": "03 January 2022", "abstract": "Energy storage provides an effective way of shifting temporal energy demands and supplies, which enables significant cost reduction under time-of-use energy pricing plans. Despite its promising benefits, the cost of present energy storage remains expensive, presenting a major obstacle to practical deployment. A more viable solution to improve the cost-effectiveness is by sharing energy storage, such as community sharing, cloud energy storage and peer-to-peer sharing. However, revealing private energy demand data to an external energy storage operator may compromise user privacy, and is susceptible to data misuses and breaches. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to support energy storage sharing with privacy protection, based on privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation. We present an integrated solution to enable privacy-preserving energy storage sharing, such that energy storage service scheduling and cost-sharing can be attained without the knowledge of individual users' demands. It also supports auditing and verification by the grid operator via blockchain. Furthermore, our privacy-preserving solution can safeguard against a majority of dishonest users, who may collude in cheating, without requiring a trusted third-party. We implemented our solution as a smart contract on real-world Ethereum blockchain platform, and provided empirical evaluation in this paper", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3508467.3508471", "Authors": ["Nan Wang", "Sid Chi-Kin Chau", "Yue Zhou"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "2770-5331", "nombredePage": "120  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Australian National University", "Australian National University", "Australian National University"], "Conference": "ACM SIGEnergy Energy Informatics Review", "doi": "10.1145/3508467", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Successful digital transformation requires confidence in and protection of digital identities. On the Internet, however, there is no unique and standard identity layer. Consequently, a variety of digital identities have emerged over years, leading to privacy risks, security vulnerabilities, risks for identity owners, and liability for identity issuers and those relying on digital identities to grant access to goods and services. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and similar forms of identity management on the blockchain distributed ledger are novel technologies that recognize the need to keep user identity privately stored in user-owned devices, securely verified by identity issuers, and only revealed to verifiers as needed. There is limited academic literature defining the prerequisite SSI functional and non-functional requirements and comparing SSI technologies. Often those SSI technologies reviewed in the literature lack behind current advances. We present the first work that compiles a comprehensive list of functional and non-functional requirements of SSI and compares an extensive number of existing SSI/blockchain-based identity management solutions with respect to these requirements. Our work sheds light on the state-of-the-art SSI development and paves the way for future, more informed analysis and development of novel identity management and SSI solutions.

These devices possess low computational resources, and as a result they cannot use security tools such as antivirus or firewalls. Consequently, they become easy targets for cyber-attacks and malware infection, thus putting a person's life at risk. One way to protect these devices from malware infection is Remote Attestation (RA), a process by which a device with low computational power (prover) verifies its internal state to a party with higher computational resources (verifier) upon the latter's request. However, in case the verifier is malicious, it may constantly send numerous requests for RA to a prover to prevent it from performing the functions it was designed for. Thus, keeping it busy and rendering it unusable to its legit users as well as services. In short, the verifier performs a Computational Denial of Service (CDoS) attack against the prover. This paper proposes the BARRETT architecture which uses a Public Ethereum Network (PEN) in conjunction with an RA protocol to protect the prover from CDoS attacks. In particular, the PEN in BARRETT deters CDoS by forcing the verifier to pay a fee in Ether cryptocurrency every time they wish to send an Attestation Request (AR) to a prover. The verifier pays the fee since in BARRETT it can send the AR only via Ethereum transactions. Consequently, any attempt to perform a CDoS becomes prohibitively expensive.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3358695.3361752", "Authors": ["Michail Bampatsikos", "Christoforos Ntantogian", "Christos Xenakis", "Stelios C.

Blockchain is capable of removing all third-party organisations by forming a smart contract, making the entire process more smooth, secure, and efficient. The contract settles the claim on documents submitted by the claimant.

{"title": "Practical Aggregate Signature from General Elliptic Curves, and Applications to Blockchain", "date": "02 July 2019", "abstract": "Aggregate signature (AS) allows non-interactively condensing multiple individual signatures into a compact one. Besides faster verification, it is useful to reduce storage and bandwidth, and is especially attractive for blockchain and cryptocurrency. In this work, we first demonstrate the subtlety of achieving AS from general groups, by a concrete attack that actually works against the natural implementations of AS based on almost all the variants of DSA and Schnorr's. Then, we show that aggregate signature can be de- rived from the -signature scheme proposed by Yao, et al. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first aggregate signature scheme from general elliptic curves without bilinear maps (in particular, the secp256k1 curve used by Bitcoin). The security of aggregate -signature is proved based on a new assumption proposed and justified in this work, referred to as non-malleable discrete-logarithm (NMDL), which might be of independent interest.

{"title": "A Network Coding Based Information Spreading Approach for Permissioned Blockchain in IoT Settings", "date": "05 November 2018", "abstract": "Permissioned Blockchain (PBC) has become a prevalent data structure to ensure that the records are immutable and secure. However, PBC still has significant challenges before it can be realized in different applications. One of such challenges is the overhead of the communication which is required to execute the Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol that is needed for consensus building. As such, it may not be feasible to implement PBC for resource constrained environments such as Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this paper, we assess the communication overhead of running BA in an IoT environment that consists of wireless nodes (e.g., Raspberry PIs) with meshing capabilities. As the the packet loss ratio is significant and makes BA unfeasible to scale, we propose a network coding based approach that will reduce the packet overhead and minimize the consensus completion time of the BA. Specifically, various network coding approaches are designed as a replacement to TCP protocol which relies on unicasting and acknowledgements. The evaluation on a network of Raspberry PIs demonstrates that our approach can significantly improve scalability making BA feasible for medium size IoT networks.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3286978.3286984", "Authors": ["Mumin Cebe", "Berkay Kaplan", "Kemal Akkaya"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450360937", "nombredePage": "490  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of ECE, Florida International University, Miami, Florida", "Dept. of Computer Science and Eng., The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio", "Department of ECE, Florida International University, Miami, Florida"], "Conference": "MobiQuitous '18: Proceedings of the 15th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services", "doi": "10.1145/3286978", "Total_Citations": "5"},

The number and variety of IoT devices are sharply increasing, and as they do, they generate significant data sources. Deep learning algorithms are increasingly integrated into IoT applications to learn and infer patterns and make intelligent decisions. However, current IoT paradigms rely on centralised storage and computing to operate the deep learning algorithms. This key central component can potentially cause issues in scalability, security threats and privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for deep learning algorithms to preserve data privacy. Although FL helps reduce privacy leakage by avoiding transferring client data, it still has many challenges related to models\u2019 vulnerabilities and attacks. With the emergence of blockchain and smart contracts, the utilisation of these technologies has the potential to safeguard FL across IoT ecosystems. This study aims to review blockchain-based FL methods for securing IoT systems holistically. It presents the current state of research in blockchain, how it can be applied to FL approaches, current IoT security issues and responses to outline the need to use emerging approaches toward the security and privacy of IoT ecosystems.

Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain.

To overcome this problem, we introduce a NFT trading platform on Hyperledger Fabric with reference to ERC-721 standard of Ethereum. ERC-721 standard is implemented by Hyperledger Fabric chaincode, which is similar to Ethereum smart contract, where all features of the current protocol are implemented.

Popular data like viral videos can be cached on edge servers to serve users with low latency. Investigating the integrity of these edge data is critical and challenging as edge servers often suffer from unreliability and constrained resources. Meanwhile, EDI (edge data integrity) investigation must be performed by edge servers collaboratively at the edge to avoid excessive backhaul network traffic. There are two main challenges in practice: 1) there is a lack of Byzantine-tolerant collaborative investigation method; and 2) edge servers may be reluctant to collaborate without proper incentives. To tackle these challenges systematically, this paper proposes a novel scheme named EdgeWatch to enable robust and collaborative EDI investigation in a decentralized manner based on blockchain. Under EdgeWatch, edge servers collaborate on EDI investigation following a novel integrity consensus. A blockchain system comprises of three main components is built as the infrastructure to facilitate integrity consensus: 1) an incentive mechanism that motivates edge servers to participate in EDI investigation; 2) a reputation system that elects reliable leaders for block consensus; and 3) a leader randomization technique that protects leaders from targeted attacks. We evaluate it against three representative schemes experimentally. The results demonstrate the high precision, efficiency, and robustness of EdgeWatch.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539104", "Authors": ["Bo Li", "Qiang He", "Liang Yuan", "Feifei Chen", "Lingjuan Lyu", "Yun Yang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450393850", "nombredePage": "5033  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia", "Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia", "Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia", "Deakin University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia", "Sony AI, Tokyo, Japan", "Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"], "Conference": "KDD '22: Proceedings of the 28th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "doi": "10.1145/3534678", "Total_Citations": "0"},

The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3490236", "Authors": ["Omar Hasan", "Lionel Brunie", "Elisa Bertino"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["survey", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "0360-0300", "nombredePage": "803  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Lyon, CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, France", "0000-0002-9585-7810", "University of Lyon, CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, France", "Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, IN"], "Conference": "ACM Computing Surveys", "doi": "1557-7341", "Total_Citations": "0"},

We build on the EBRM architecture and construct a Blockchain-Based Root Management (BBRM) to provide even greater decentralization and security. More specifically, BBRM uses blockchain to i) replace the existing RCA and have the electors directly involved in the root certificate generation, ii) control the elector network membership including elector addition and revocation, and iii) provide greater accountability and transparency on the aforementioned functionalities. We implement BBRM on Hyperledger Fabric using smart contract for system experimentation and analyses. Our experiments show that BBRM is lightweight in processing, efficient in ledger size, and supports a bandwidth of multiple transactions per second. Our results show that the BBRM blockchain is appropriate for the root certificate generation and the elector membership control for EBRM within SCMS, which are significantly smaller in number and occurrences than the SCMS outputs of vehicle certificates.

Therefore, to improve the security of private information in medical systems, this article uses blockchain technology to design a method to protect private information in medical systems and effectively realize anti-theft control of private information. First, the Patient-oriented Privacy Preserving Access Control model is introduced into the access control process of private information in medical systems. Next, a private information storage platform is built by using blockchain technology, and information transmission is realized using standard cryptographic algorithms. In this process, file authorization contracts are also used to guarantee the security of private information and further prevent theft of medical private information. Our simulation results show that the storage response time of this method is kept below 1,000 ms, and the maximum information throughput rate reaches 550 kbit/s, which indicates that this method has strong performance in information storage and transmission efficiency. Moreover, the reliability and bandwidth utilization of data transmission across domains is higher, so the method has higher information security control performance and superior overall performance.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3408321", "Authors": ["Hongjiao Wu", "Ashutosh Dhar Dwivedi", "Gautam Srivastava"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1551-6857", "nombredePage": "349  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Henan Vocational College of Tuina, Xuefu Street, Luoyang, China", "DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark", "Brandon University, Canada and China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan", "0000-0001-9851-4103"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications", "doi": "1551-6865", "Total_Citations": "2"},
{"title": "Performance Evaluation of a Patient-Centric Blockchain-based Healthcare Records Management Framework", "date": "25 August 2020", "abstract": "Healthcare records management system has been revolutionized over the last decade aiming to provide accurate, efficient and enhanced patient care. The existing management system is either based on a client/server approach where each hospital maintains its own database or on a cloud approach where the health records are stored in a cloud server and managed by a third-party cloud service provider. However, these approaches suffer from the issues of security, privacy, data vulnerability and fragmentation. Furthermore, healthcare providers and patients are unable to have a unified view of a patient's medical history from all visited medical care centers. This results in additional treatment costs, repeated medical tests and increased time to diagnosis. The data traceability, immutability, transparency, replication, security and privacy traits of the emerging blockchain technology have a promising potential in the healthcare domain addressing these issues. In this paper, we propose BlockHR, a patient-centric healthcare records management system for efficient medical care at an optimal cost. The system enables healthcare providers to enter the patients' medical record data to the blockchain network and allows patients to enter their social data such as sleeping habits, physical activities, and current location. Consequently, BlockHR provides support to doctors for better diagnosis and prognosis. We evaluate the performance of BlockHR in terms of execution time and the total amount of data transferred for ledger update with an increasing number of hospitals and blocks in the network.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3409934.3409941", "Authors": ["Leila Ismail", "Huned Materwala", "Moien AB Khan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377706", "nombredePage": "184  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE", "Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University Al, Ain, UAE", "Department of Family Medicine College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab University, Al Ain, UAE and Primary Care, NHS North West London, United Kingdom"], "Conference": "IECC '20: Proceedings of the 2nd International Electronics Communication Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3409934", "Total_Citations": "6"},

{"title": "Intra-Shard and Inter-Shard Collaborative Incentive Scheme for Shard-Based Permissionless Blockchain", "date": "07 March 2022", "abstract": " Shard-Based blockchain technology is currently one of the effective ways to improve the throughput of permissionless blockchain. By distributing transactions into multiple shards, the validators in each shard verify transactions and reach in consensus in parallel, thereby increasing system throughput and scalability. However, most of the existing Shard-Based Blockchain schemes lack an incentive scheme that can promote mutual cooperation among the nodes in the shard and participate in consensus as much as possible, which leads some selfish nodes to adopt strategies that are not conducive to the maintenance of the blockchain system in order to obtain higher profits, thereby endangering the stability and security of the entire blockchain system. In this paper, we introduce the concept of node reputation to evaluate node behavior, and establish the correlation between reputation and profit. In that case, nodes with higher reputation can get more rewards, thereby achieving the fairness of reward distribution. In addition, we use the N-player static game model in game theory to analyze the changes in utility corresponding to different strategies for node, and design a dynamic transaction distribution scheme through genetic algorithm(GA) to ensure that the majority of nodes participate in consensus and shard liveness. Our research results show that our solution can better improve incentive fairness and liveness compared to the general transaction uniform distribution scheme.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3507971.3507995", "Authors": ["HENG QUAN", "TIANYU KANG", "LI GUO"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450385190", "nombredePage": "252  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China and Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China", "School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China and Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China", "School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China and Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"], "Conference": "ICCIP 2021: 2021 the 7th International Conference on Communication and Information Processing (ICCIP)", "doi": "10.1145/3507971", "Total_Citations": "0"},

However, due to the complexity of this architecture, there exists endless attacks against blockchain. Smart contracts as the application layer prototype of blockchain, face more severe security risks. This paper detailly lists the security events of smart contracts in recent years, summarizes several common attack modes, then introduces their principles and analyzes the commonness. Finally, an original version of the contract code audit tool based on matching rules is given. The tool can ensure that the contract has a complete audit process before deployment, so as to decrease the DApp vulnerability caused by poor programming. Moreover, the matching rule library supports customization, the tool can be updated timely to enhance its audit ability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3444370.3444617", "Authors": ["Ziyuan Li", "Wangshu Guo", "Quan Xu", "Yingjie Xu", "Huimei Wang", "Ming Xian"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387828", "nombredePage": "597  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["National University of Defense Technology, College of Electronic Science and Technology, Changsha, China", "National University of Defense Technology, College of Electronic Science and Technology, Changsha, China", "National University of Defense Technology, College of Electronic Science and Technology, Changsha, China", "National University of Defense Technology, College of Electronic Science and Technology, Changsha, China", "National University of Defense Technology, College of Electronic Science and Technology, Changsha, China", "National University of Defense Technology, College of Electronic Science and Technology, Changsha, China"], "Conference": "CIAT 2020: Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Cyberspace Innovation of Advanced Technologies", "doi": "10.1145/3444370", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Unfortunately, new participants of the blockchain network are required to download the whole blockchain to gain an overview about the state of the system and to validate incoming transactions.

Unfortunately, they focus on strategies slowing down the blockchain's growth instead of reducing the problems arising from a growing chain or introduce new concepts to oust the linear blockchain altogether. The approach proposed in this paper is based on the idea of Ethereum to keep the state of the system explicitly in the current block but further pursues this by including the relevant part of the current system state in new transactions as well. This enables other participants to validate incoming transactions without having to download the whole blockchain initially.

COVID-19 pandemic has neither clinically proven vaccine nor drugs so far. It is now obvious that the world is in dire need for non-clinical, real-time, faster and cost-effective and secure smart solutions for monitoring, contact tracing, and diagnosing/detecting COVID-19 patients and hence mitigating the burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, Machine learning approaches can be leveraged in all aspects that could impact the patients and the future care guidelines. However, ensuring the data privacy, security and the conformity to data protection regulations will become even more of a challenge. This leads to the requirement for secured and privacy-preserving machine learning mechanisms for COVID-19-based healthcare applications. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based privacy-preserving support vector machine (SVM) classification over vertically partitioned IoMT data for a clinical decision support (CDS) system.

It also investigates the relationship between the consensus rate set by the user and the hacker's attack success rate through simulation. Our suggestions and simulation results suggest how to control nodes when using blockchain for Home IoT and show how to be safe from 51% attack.

We develop an economic model of the Proof-of-Work based blockchain system. Our model allows miners to pause operation when the expected reward is below the shutdown point. Hence, the supply of aggregate hash power can be elastic in the cryptocurrency price and the difficulty target of the mining puzzle. We prove that, when the hash supply is elastic, the Bitcoin DAA fails to adjust the block arrival rate to the targeted level. In contrast, the DAA of another blockchain system, Bitcoin Cash, is shown to be stable even when the cryptocurrency price is volatile and the supply of hash power is highly elastic. We also provide empirical evidence and simulation results supporting the model's prediction. Our results indicate that the current Bitcoin system might collapse if a sharp price reduction lowers the reward for mining denominated in fiat money. While this crisis can be prevented through the upgrading of DAA, we also discuss that a large fraction of miners may disagree with upgrading the DAA because they can obtain a larger expected profit from an unstable DAA.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3391403.3399475", "Authors": ["Shunya Noda", "Kyohei Okumura", "Yoshinori Hashimoto"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["abstract"], "ISBN": "9781450379755", "nombredePage": "937  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada", "University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Japan", "Turingum K.K., Chiyoda, Japan"], "Conference": "EC '20: Proceedings of the 21st ACM Conference on Economics and Computation", "doi": "10.1145/3391403", "Total_Citations": "4"},

In a blockchain, seen also as a distributed ledger or a chain of blocks, the participants use a consensus protocol to add new data into the ledger. For example, in the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work consensus protocol, the participants have to unnecessarily invest a huge amount of energy to add a new block of transactions, and therefore to also win the coin associated to this block. Several consensus protocols have been proposed to overcome this waste and resource intensive process. In this paper, we present a new consensus protocol for blockchain technologies called Useful Work (UW). Our UW protocol is based on the Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work mechanisms where the computing work is dedicated to useful problems.

Therefore, a mechanism is needed for each domain to cooperate with each other and share information about the attack source, so as to realize the defense against DDoS attacks across multiple domains. Blockchain technology's decentralization and group trusted collaboration mechanism provide a new method for solving cross-domain DDoS attack defense.

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to examine the characteristics and functionalities of blockchain technology and to identify blockchain-based solutions to address consumer product traceability issues, as well as to highlight the benefits of implementing blockchain-based traceability systems by proposing a blockchain architecture to ensure traceability and transparency.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3523181.3523182", "Authors": ["Jonathan Lenge", "Kaninda Musumbu", "Geisla Wanuku", "Pascal Sungu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387453", "nombredePage": "202  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Computer Science, Nouveaux Horizons University, Democratic Republic of Congo", "Computer Science, Nouveaux Horizons University, Democratic Republic of Congo", "Management Science, Nouveaux Horizons University, Democratic Republic of Congo", "Computer Science, Nouveaux Horizons University, Democratic Republic of Congo"], "Conference": "ASSE' 22: 2022 3rd Asia Service Sciences and Software Engineering Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3523181", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "Employing Blockchain and Physical Unclonable Functions for Counterfeit IoT Devices Detection", "date": "05 May 2019", "abstract": "Counterfeit copycat devices have become one of the most important problems in IoT ecosystem. The number of IoT devices manufactured has grown exponentially through last years. In order to be competitive in terms of production cost, they usually need to assemble devices by using ready components built by other manufacturers. This scheme results in a high risk that produced IoT devices do not function properly due to malfunctioning components. This can either be related to component manufacturers trying to minimize costs or even to malicious practices for violating privacy or security of end users of such devices. In this paper a novel approach for preventing such counterfeit copycat practices is presented. The proposed methodology is based on identifying each one of the used components through the use of PUF responses and employing blockchain technology, in order to set-up a platform for tracking the supply chain of both component and IoT devices, without requiring the existence of any central authority.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3312614.3312650", "Authors": ["Lydia Negka", "Georgios Gketsios", "Nikolaos A.

However, these systems are often heterogeneous and designed in an isolated way that makes it challenging to integrate with each other. One of the ways to integrate systems that provide interoperability is the System-of-system concept. Communication among systems depends on mutual agreements made by intermediaries. It increases the cost, constrains collaboration, and distrusts shared data and services.

As an instance of deep learning models, generative adversarial nets (GAN) model enables powerful and flexible image augmentation, image generation, and classification, thus can be applied to real-world CPSS settings. GAN model training needs a large collection of cyber-physical-social data originating from various CPSS devices. Numerous prevailing GAN models depend on a tacit assumption that several cyber-physical-social data providers present a reliable source to collect training data, which is seldom the case in real CPSS. The existing GAN models also fail to consider multi-dimensional latent structure. In our work, we put forward a novel blockchain-enabled tensor-based conditional deep convolutional GAN (TCDC-GAN) model for cyber-physical-social systems. The blockchain is employed to develop a decentralized and reliable cyber-physical-social data-sharing platform between numerous cyber-physical-social data providers, such that the training data and the model are documented on a ledger that is distributed. Furthermore, a tensor-based generator and a tensor-based discriminator are well designed by employing the tensor model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show the efficacy of the proposed TCDC-GAN model.

Not only developing countries but also developed countries need to be concerned about applying blockchain technology to their e-government system. Blockchain technology has brought a very deep innovation over conventional Client Server Trusted Third Party intermediary system to pure peer-to-peer (P2P) based smart contract system. This smart contract based peer-to-peer system allow participants to share data which was not possible under Client Server Trusted Third Party system due to architectural monopoly nature of Client Server. Smart contract concept brought logical conditions to share data among participants but it does not provide any definition about data value.

The forthcoming 5G is expected to allow low-power massive IoT devices to produce high volumes of data that can be transmitted over ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. However, IoT systems encounter several security and privacy issues to prevent unauthorized access to IoT nodes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel blockchain-based architecture that leverages Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for securing IoT transactions. A novel security appliance is introduced in a form of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) for improving the scalability and performance of IoT networks. Then, we introduce a novel consensus algorithm to detect and report suspected IoT nodes and mitigate malicious traffic. We evaluate and compare our proposed solution against three well-known consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), and Proof of Stake (PoS).

{"title": "Designing a Blockchain Data Storage System Using Ethereum Architecture and Peer-to-Peer InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)", "date": "07 March 2022", "abstract": "In this study, a higher level of security was implemented by using InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) based peer-to-peer data storage on an Ethereum blockchain. IPFS is used as an image data storage medium that generates an IPFS hash, or known as content identifier (CID). The CID is used to access image data on the IPFS, which can be done with the help of an IPFS gateway. The CID is sent into the blockchain using a smart contract. The results of the study demonstrates that the use of IPFS as additional security on a blockchain system can be done. The size of file sent using IPFS proportionally affects the time it takes for IPFS to store the file. The larger the file size, the more time it will take. For each additional 1\u00a0MB file, there is an approximately 5% increase in access time. The distance from the IPFS gateway will also affect file access times in which, the farther the IPFS gateway, the more time it takes. If the IPFS gateway is at a distance of 1,000\u00a0km, there will be a decrease in access time of about 5%. The distance between the IPFS gateway and the accessor also affects success with accessing data. For the most distant gateway, i.e. the United States, there was even an access failure of 24%.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3507971.3507997", "Authors": ["Ananda Rizky Duto Pamungkas", "Diyanatul Husna", "Fransiskus Astha Ekadiyanto", "I Ketut Eddy Purnama", "Afif Nurul Hidayati", "Mauridhi Hery Purnomo", "Ingrid Nurtanio", "Reza Fuad Rachmadi", "Supeno Mardi Susiki Nugroho", "Anak Agung Putri Ratna"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450385190", "nombredePage": "252  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia", "Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia", "Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia", "Department of Computer Engineering, Sepuluh November Institute of Technology, Indonesia", "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Airlangga University, Indonesia", "Department of Computer Engineering, Sepuluh November Institute of Technology, Indonesia", "Department of Informatics, Hassanudin University, Indonesia", "Department of Computer Engineering, Sepuluh November Institute of Technology, Indonesia", "Department of Computer Engineering, Sepuluh November Institute of Technology, Indonesia", "Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia"], "Conference": "ICCIP 2021: 2021 the 7th International Conference on Communication and Information Processing (ICCIP)", "doi": "10.1145/3507971", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "BACKM-EHA: A novel blockchain-enabled security solution for IoMT-based e-healthcare applications", "date": "24 March 2022", "abstract": "E-health is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for the healthcare related services. It uses various types of digital technologies and telecommunications, such as computers, sensing devices, Internet, and mobile devices to deliver medical services. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a communication environment optimized for low power devices (for example, health sensors and actuators) and operation on, in or around the human body (i.e., a patient). It can be used in various applications which are related to healthcare, such as \u201cbody automation\u201d, \u201chealthcare\u201d, \u201cmedical monitoring\u201d, \u201cbody interaction\u201d and \u201cmedical implants (i.e., pacemaker)\u201d. Most of the communications happen in IoMT based e-healthcare system are wireless in nature. This may cause severe threats to the security of the system. Various information security related attacks i.e., replay, man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM), impersonation, privileged insider, unauthorised session key computation, credentials leakage, stolen verifier, malware injection are possible in IoMT based e-healthcare system. These threats and attacks can create serious problems in the social life of an individual as this may reveal their confidential healthcare information to other unauthorised parties. Therefore, it is essential to propose an access control and key management scheme to secure the communication of a IoMT based e-healthcare system. Moreover, the security of such kind of scheme can also be enhanced through the deployment of a blockchain mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a blockchain enabled access control and key management protocol for IoMT based e-healthcare system which is named as \u201cBACKM-EHA\u201d in short. The security analysis of proposed BACKM-EHA is also provided through the standard i.e., \u201cReal-Or-Random model\u201d. The various conducted security analyses prove the security of BACKM-EHA against the different types of potential attacks.

Therefore, the participation of the private sector in the financing aspect is encouraged to improve the project viability and enhance the performance of the capital budget. This research aims to develop an alternative public-private partnership (PPP) model that can attract the interest of both institutional and individual private investors, by proposing financing model that incorporate the crowdfunding method. To achieve its objective, this research adopts both qualitative and quantitative methods conducted in three stages, by firstly carrying out desk study and benchmarking to develop the crowdfunding-based PPP financing scheme, and followed by life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis in the next stage, to examine the financial feasibility of the proposed scheme by taking into account the initial cost, operation & maintenance, and revenue. Lastly, along with an institutional scheme considering the sharing of investment and responsibilities between private companies and individual crowdfunders, this research also formulates the workflow of the transactions conducted in the crowdfunding framework built in the Blockchain platform. The results of this study show that the crowdfunding-based PPP model is feasible to be developed in the investment of landed housing projects of the port-city development, with 15.54% of the internal rate of return obtained from the implementation of the proposed financing mechanism.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3444465.3444476", "Authors": ["Mohammed Ali Berawi", "Gabriel Reyes", "Mustika Sari", "Gunawan Saroji"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450388313", "nombredePage": "447  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia", "Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia", "Center for Sustainable Infrastructure Development, Depok, Indonesia", "Center for Sustainable Infrastructure Development, Depok, Indonesia"], "Conference": "SPBPU IDE '20: Proceedings of the 2nd International Scientific Conference on Innovations in Digital Economy", "doi": "10.1145/3444465", "Total_Citations": "1"},
{"title": "A blockchain-based framework for energy trading between solar powered base stations and grid", "date": "11 October 2020", "abstract": "The rapidly increasing mobile traffic across the globe has proliferated the deployment of cellular base stations, which has, in turn, led to an increase in the power consumption and carbon footprint of the telecommunications industry. In recent times, solar-powered base stations (SPBSs) have gained much popularity in the telecom sector due to their ability to make operations more sustainable. However, some potential energy benefits rendered by the SPBSs have not yet been realized. In areas with dense base station deployment or low mobile traffic, SPBSs store surplus energy, which, in most instances, gets lost due to limited charge storage capacity of the batteries. To limit the wastage of energy, an appropriate mechanism enabling the utilization of excess energy produced by these base stations can be adopted. To this end, we model a Base Station-to-Grid (BS2G) network in which the grid can utilize surplus energy spared by the SPBSs. To overcome challenges in regards to scalability, robustness, and cost-optimization, we propose using the blockchain technology to create the BS2G network. Blockchain is a distributed ledger designed to record transactions in a transparent, lightweight, and tamper-proof manner. To make energy trade between base stations and the grid cost-effective, a game-theoretical approach has also been adopted in this paper. The proposed model simplifies the process of energy trading while also making it cost-optimal.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3397166.3412800", "Authors": ["Vikas Hassija", "Vatsal Gupta", "Vinay Chamola", "Salil Kanhare"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450380157", "nombredePage": "384  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India", "Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India", "Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani, India", "University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia"], "Conference": "Mobihoc '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-First International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3397166", "Total_Citations": "3"},

It can save energy and reduce emissions, reduce environmental pollution, waste of resources, and harm to human body and environment, in which green smart device (GSD) is a basic unit of GIoT for saving energy. With the access of a large number of heterogeneous bottom-layer GSDs in GIoT, user access and control of GSDs have become more and more complicated. Since there is no unified GSD management system, users need to operate different GIoT applications and access different GIoT cloud platforms when accessing and controlling these heterogeneous GSDs. This fragmented GSD management model not only increases the complexity of user access and control for heterogeneous GSDs, but also reduces the scalability of GSDs applications. To address this issue, this article presents a blockchain-empowered general GSD access control framework, which provides users with a unified GSD management platform.

{"title": "Temporal analysis of cooperative behaviour in a blockchain for humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic", "date": "07 September 2022", "abstract": " In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the subject of blockchain technology for good. Among the many endeavours, blockchain technology has lately been exploited to build complementary currencies in the sphere of humanitarian aid: currencies that support national economies to provide humanitarian aid and promote development. While there have been numerous research projects on complementary currencies (CCs) and their success, some critical aspects remain largely unexplored. First, even though cooperation is a key factor in the development of these systems, as local communities organize themselves in times of crisis, there is a lack of studies that investigate the cooperative behaviour in these systems and how it changes over time. Besides, there are only a few works studying these currencies during the recent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we investigate Sarafu, a digital complementary currency based on blockchain technology. To support cooperation, Sarafu implements a special type of account, the group account, thus allowing the study of cooperation groups, that cannot be easily analyzed in other CC systems; furthermore, it was successfully used for humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that Sarafu users show strong cooperative behaviour, facilitated by the usage of these group accounts. Furthermore, we observe the increasing importance of cooperation groups over time, as well as differences over time in their spending behaviour. From the analysis, we highlight the presence of cooperation patterns and the importance of group accounts, a takeaway for current and future humanitarian projects.

By mid-decade, with full country wide deployment, there will be almost 1.3 billion smart meters in place \\citeinfo. Collection of fine-grained energy usage data by these smart meters provides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of demand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing programs, bidirectional information exchange ability between end-users for better consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks associated with fine-grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy of users. With this technology, customers' personal data such as sleeping cycle, number of occupants, and even type and number of appliances stream into the hands of the utility companies and can be subject to misuse. This research paper addresses privacy violation of consumers' energy usage data collected from smart meters and provides a novel solution for the privacy protection while allowing benefits of energy data analytics. First, we demonstrate the successful application of occupancy detection attacks using a deep neural network method that yields high accuracy results. We then introduce Adversarial Machine Learning Occupancy Detection Avoidance with Blockchain (AMLODA-B) framework as a counter-attack by deploying an algorithm based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model into the standardized smart metering infrastructure to prevent leakage of consumer's personal information.

{"title": "On the Security and Scalability of Bitcoin's Blockchain", "date": "24 October 2016", "abstract": "The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool which proves to be useful in a number of application scenarios. A number of large industrial players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are currently investing in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their portfolio of products. A number of researchers and practitioners speculate that the blockchain technology can change the way we see a number of online applications today. Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a large number of products and will positively impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe. In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of \"altcoins\" which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code. Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the Bitcoin system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2976756", "Authors": ["Ghassan Karame"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["tutorial"], "ISBN": "9781450341394", "nombredePage": "1924  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["NEC Laboratories Europe, Heidelberg, Germany"], "Conference": "CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/2976749", "Total_Citations": "67"},

However, gaps in security and scalability hinder the development of real-world applications. In this study, we propose ScaleSFL, which is a scalable blockchain-based sharding solution for federated learning. ScaleSFL supports interoperability by separating the off-chain federated learning component in order to verify model updates instead of controlling the entire federated learning flow. We implemented ScaleSFL as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric to demonstrate the feasibility of the solution. We present a performance evaluation of results collected through Hyperledger Caliper benchmarking tools conducted on model creation. Our evaluation results show that sharding can improve validation performance linearly while remaining efficient and secure.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3494106.3528680", "Authors": ["Evan Madill", "Ben Nguyen", "Carson K.

Nevertheless, the management of the construction effort is still very manual. The construction process from design, to sourcing of material, contract management, and so on, is a convoluted and intransparent process filled with risks the collaborating parties are exposed to. A need exists for management platforms that streamline and automate collaborative construction processes, establish transparency, traceability, and information symmetry between business parties. This paper presents the Construction Project Management (CoPM) platform that is based on blockchain- and smart-contract technologies for enabling peer-to-peer collaboration between construction parties that enhances the flow of information for reducing cost- and time expenditures while improving the quality of service. The CoPM system is based on diligent up-front requirement studies from which we derive a coherent system architecture and set of cooperation protocols.

By leveraging the bidirectional energy trading capabilities of V2G, demand-supply mismatch is managed in wide range of applications. However, performing energy trading decisions at cloud centers leads to increased delay and overhead. The demand to process the 3V's (variety, volume, and velocity) of data generated by V2G with low latency necessitates the usage of edge computing services. Although with the growth of edge computing resources, the trust issue of collaboration also grows among different stakeholders and service providers. Therefore, to deal with the aforementioned issues, this paper presents blockchain and UAV-enabled edge computing based energy trading services for the V2G environment. The decision of selecting a charging station (CS) by an electric vehicle (EV) is processed close to the EV movement via edge nodes. To secure and validate energy trading transactions and automation of the whole system, the blockchain technology is used in the proposal.

{"title": "Pervasive Smart Contracts for Blockchains in IoT Systems", "date": "10 December 2018", "abstract": "Thanks to its decentralized structure and immutability, blockchain technology has the potential to address relevant security and privacy challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, by hosting and executing smart contracts, blockchain allows secure, flexible, and traceable message communication between IoT devices. The unique characteristics of IoT systems, such as heterogeneity and pervasiveness, however, pose challenges in designing smart contracts for such systems. In this paper, we study these challenges and propose a design approach for smart contracts used in IoT systems. The main goal of our design model is to enhance the development of IoT smart contracts based on the inherent pervasive attributes of IoT systems. In particular, the design model allows the smart contracts to encapsulate functionalities such as contractlevel communication between IoT devices, access to data-sources within contracts, and interoperability of heterogeneous IoT smart contracts. The essence of our approach is structuring the design of IoT smart contracts as self-contained software services, inspired by the microservice architecture model. The flexibility, scalability and modularity of this model make it an efficient approach for developing pervasive IoT smart contracts.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3301403.3301405", "Authors": ["Amir Taherkordi", "Peter Herrmann"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450366465", "nombredePage": "32  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway and Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway", "Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"], "Conference": "ICBTA 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Blockchain Technology and Application", "doi": "10.1145/3301403", "Total_Citations": "5"},

In recent years, studies have focused on identifying opportunities and barriers of blockchain-based applications for government, and multiple piloting initiatives have been started to experiment and test the potential of this technology. Nevertheless, many of these blockchain initiatives are in the pilot stage. For the initiatives that have reached a large-scale implementation or production stage, these are largely on a local (municipal) or national level. There is limited research on operational blockchain-enabled infrastructures implemented on a global level and how they can be used by government organizations to create value. This is an area that we set out to explore with this paper. In this paper, we take the specific focus on business-government information sharing via a global blockchain-enabled platform (TradeLens) to create value for business and government. As a case study, we focus on examining the case of importing tires from China to the Netherlands and the value creation processes for the tire importer and customs enabled by information sharing via the TradeLens platform.

{"title": "Blockchain-based Learning Credential Revision and Revocation Method", "date": "07 October 2020", "abstract": "Many blockchain-based learning credential systems have been proposed to reduce fraud and improve verification efficiency. In addition to a method for issuing and verifying credentials, a solution is needed to support the revision and revocation of an issued credential record. For the case of learning credentials, depending on how a revocation policy affects credential use that occurred before the revocation date, an additional mechanism may be needed for credential revision. Current digital learning credential methods offer only a revocation mechanism. So they do not fully meet such unique requirement in the education context. In this paper, a blockchain-based method for learning credential revision and revocation is proposed. It makes use of the revision and revocation addresses assigned to each batch of issuing credentials. To revise (revoke) one or more credentials, the proposed method stores the revision (revocation) list as a message in the OP_RETURN field of the revision (revocation) transaction, with the revision (revocation) address as one of its outputs. The concept of a local credential id has been introduced to allow a revision (revocation) list to be efficiently stored on a blockchain system. It is based entirely on a blockchain system and does not require any centralized authority. It is also applicable to most blockchain systems. A comparative study of the proposed method against existing credential revocation methods is also provided.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3368308.3415456", "Authors": ["Aye Mi San", "Nopporn Chotikakamthorn", "Chanboon Sathitwiriyawong"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper"], "ISBN": "9781450370455", "nombredePage": "446  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand", "King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand", "King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"], "Conference": "SIGITE '20: Proceedings of the 21st Annual Conference on Information Technology Education", "doi": "10.1145/3368308", "Total_Citations": "2"},

Ethereum, a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contracts, introduces an interesting ecosystem of human users and autonomous agents (the contracts). It is the most actively used blockchain platform, hosting ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as its native store of value. The Ethereum blockchain contains a vast amount of user-to-user, user-to-contract, contract-to -user, and contract-to-contract interactions that can be modeled as complex networks. To mine these interactions as graphs through a preferred analytics toolbox, an end-user has to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the required data into the desired network format. However, it is costly and time-consuming to manage the ETL pipeline for the massive and complex blockchain data. To support research in this domain, we develop an end-to-end, automated tool - EtherNet, which performs ETL tasks from a single source of truth (Google BigQuery), and provides graph equivalent representations for visualization and mining on the entire Ethereum blockchain network.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3488560.3502187", "Authors": ["Voon Hou Su", "Sourav Sen Gupta", "Arijit Khan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper"], "ISBN": "9781450391320", "nombredePage": "1690  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore", "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore", "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"], "Conference": "WSDM '22: Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining", "doi": "10.1145/3488560", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "An Auditable and Secure Model for Permissioned Blockchain", "date": "07 July 2019", "abstract": "The intrinsic tamper-resistant characteristic of blockchain enables transaction to be permanently stored as immutable record, which provides extremely reliable information traceability for some application scenarios such as supply chain and copyright protection. However, in fact, even the Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm cannot fundamentally guarantee that transaction information is real and legitimate in reality. Therefore, the normal operation of the blockchain system requires the establishment of a special supervisory body to audit the transaction information, which can ensure that the data sources are credible rather than spurious or illegal. In addition, in the environment of permissioned blockchain, the realization of access mechanism often relies on centralized certificate authority. Unfortunately, a highly centralized management entity is not entirely trustworthy and reliable because it may be corrupt or attacked, which inevitably triggers many information security incidents such as privacy leakage and data loss. In order to realize the secure governance of permissioned blockchain system, a novel multi-supervised permissioned blockchain (MSPB) model is proposed in this paper, which supports auditing and eliminates the centralized entities in the system, including certification authority and auditing authority.

DLTs, such as blockchain, are often presented as enabling technologies for self-governing communities, provided by their consensus mechanisms, transparent administration, and incentives for collaboration and cooperation. Yet, these affordances may also undermine public values such as privacy and displace human agency in governance procedures. In this paper, the conflicts regarding the governance of communities which collectively manage and produce a commons are discussed through the case of a fictional energy community. Three mechanisms are identified in this process: tracking use of and contributions to the commons; managing resources, and negotiating the underlying rule sets and user rights. Our effort is aimed at contributing to the HCI community by introducing a framework of three mechanisms and six design dilemmas that can aid in balancing conflicting values in the design of local platforms for commons-based resource management.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376660", "Authors": ["Nazli Cila", "Gabriele Ferri", "Martijn de Waal", "Inte Gloerich", "Tara Karpinski"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450367080", "nombredePage": "10688  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Avans University of Applied Sciences, Den Bosch, Netherlands"], "Conference": "CHI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3313831", "Total_Citations": "22"},

It employs the blockchain in two ways: as data storage, and to implement a rewarding mechanism for pieces of content that are relevant to the users. Employing a rewarding system based on the social activity of the users can have a strong impact on how people socialise.

For having a reliable blockchain and double-spending prevention, we need a decentralized consensus and agreement on a blockchain. Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW). It is a cryptographic puzzle that is difficult to solve but easy to verify. However, because of significant latency of proof-of-work for transactions confirmation, this consensus mechanism is vulnerable against double-spending. On the other hand, PoW consumes a significant amount of energy that by growing the network, it becomes a major problematic of this consensus mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to PoW, because of all its major problems and security issues that may lead to collapsing decentralization of the blockchain, while a full decentralized system is the main purpose of using blockchain technology. The approach we introduce is based on a distributed voting process and called \"RDV: Register, Deposit, Vote\".

The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer.

However, the increasing number of cross-shard transactions in blockchain sharding protocols may degrade the system throughput. In this paper, we investigate how to distribute users properly in the shard-based blockchains to boost the system transaction performance. We first build an open Jackson queueing network model to capture users' transaction dynamics on shards. Then we cast users' interactions as a shard-based blockchain game, wherein each user aims to minimize its transaction confirmation time and transaction fee. We investigate the equilibrium of the game, and design a polynomial-time algorithm to find efficient equilibria with good system performance. We further design a novel sharding protocol with dynamic user distribution for the permissionless blockchain, and the protocol can maintain good performance in long-term dynamic environment. Extensive numerical results using realistic blockchain transaction data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm and the designed protocol can achieve superior performance for shard-based blockchains.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3466772.3467051", "Authors": ["Canhui Chen", "Qian Ma", "Xu Chen", "Jianwei Huang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450385589", "nombredePage": "286  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China", "School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China", "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, Pazhou Lab, Guangzhou, China", "School of Science and Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"], "Conference": "MobiHoc '21: Proceedings of the Twenty-second International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3466772", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "Towards Scalable and Private Industrial Blockchains", "date": "02 April 2017", "abstract": "The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool that has the potential to positively impact the way we design a number of online applications today. In many ways, the blockchain technology is, however, still not mature enough to cater for industrial standards. Namely, existing Byzantine tolerant permission-based blockchain deployments can only scale to a limited number of nodes. These systems typically require that all transactions (and their order of execution) are publicly available to all nodes in the system, which comes at odds with common data sharing practices in the industry, and prevents a centralized regulator from overseeing the full blockchain system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain architecture devised specifically to meet industrial standards. Our proposal leverages the notion of satellite chains that can privately run different consensus protocols in parallel - thereby considerably boosting the scalability premises of the system. Our solution also accounts for a hands-off regulator that oversees the entire network, enforces specific policies by means of smart contracts, etc. We implemented our solution and integrated it with Hyperledger Fabric v0.6.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3055518.3055531", "Authors": ["Wenting Li", "Alessandro Sforzin", "Sergey Fedorov", "Ghassan O.

Among the implemented technologies, blockchain technology has some problems related to data integrity and information security in the Brazilian electronic government. However, the research understands that there are records of blockchain technology projects in federal government agencies making each architecture-independent.

In this case, the biggest challenge is the regulation of blockchain technology in e-government to ensure the legal certainty of processes in public administration. Despite the varied literature on blockchain technology, few studies are focusing on regulation, especially in Brazil. The purpose of this particular initiative is to contribute to the research and practice of the Brazilian e-government in building a legal draft for blockchain technology.

{"title": "Trustworthy Traffic Information Sharing Secured via Blockchain in VANETs", "date": "16 November 2020", "abstract": "The extensive use of vehicles, especially with the emergency of autonomous driving, urges the improvement of traffic safety. Prevalent approaches, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Internet of Things (IoT) system and Artificial Intelligence (AI), have demonstrated their strength in preventing road accidents, with the support of trustworthy data. However, in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), data transmission and storage are unreliable due to various constraints such as limited physical resource and unsteady topology. Distributed schemes are widely applied in VANETs to enforce multifold protection on vehicular data. In particular, Blockchain has become a promising approach, as it implements the real-sense distributed solution with consensus algorithm and distributed ledger. To this end, we propose a novel system in this paper, which employs Blockchain technology to consolidate the traffic information sharing in VANETs and holds profound significance for intelligent applications. Our system focuses on sharing real-time visual traffic information at the frame level via Blockchain in VANETs. Integrity verification of frames based on their sequences and timestamps is imposed prior to the consensus in Blockchain, coupled with digital watermarking to protect the multimedia traffic data. Improved efficiency and reliability of sharing are achieved by the system dynamically adjusting transaction volume in terms of the frame type and number. With the fault tolerance and immutability of Blockchain, our proposal can solidly protect the traffic information sharing against vandalization in VANETs, and confidently escort the traffic with trustworthy safety guidance.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3416014.3424601", "Authors": ["Zhaowei Ma", "F.

Teams consisting of members from around the globe can be assembled on an as-needed basis. However, this can prove to be a complex managerial task. Individuals, who believe that their efforts are not being effectively monitored by upper management, lose their motivation to fully contribute to the best of their abilities as they do not believe there is any correlation between the effort they exert and the reward they receive. With low levels of intrinsic involvement among employees, a lack of task visibility from upper management and limited social interaction among group members, many organisations struggle to combat the issue of social loafing in cross functional working groups. Blockchain technology, widely acknowledged as enabling openness, can facilitate the development of an immutable, transparent, secure and verifiable application for capturing individuals Intellectual Property as they work.

{"title": "Is my transaction done yet? An empirical study of transaction processing times in the Ethereum Blockchain Platform", "date": "19 July 2022", "abstract": "Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as \u00d0Apps. When engineering \u00d0Apps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective \u00d0Apps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., \u00d0App developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8m. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan\u2019s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap transaction. EthGasStation\u2019s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, \u00d0App developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3549542", "Authors": ["Michael Pacheco", "Gustavo A.

{"title": "Leveraging Federated Learning & Blockchain to counter Adversarial Attacks in Incremental Learning", "date": "07 October 2020", "abstract": "Whereas data labelling in IoT applications is costly, it is also time consuming to train a supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. Hence, a human oracle is required to gradually annotate the data patterns at run-time to improve the models\u2019 learning behavior, through an active learning strategy in form of User Feedback Process (UFP). Consequently, it is worth to note that during UFP there may exist malicious content that may subject the learning model to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, more so, manipulative attacks. We argue in this position paper, that there are instances during incremental learning, where the local data model may present wrong output, if retraining is done using data that has already been subjected to adversarial attack. We propose a Distributed Interactive Secure Federated Learning (DISFL) framework that utilizes UFP in the edge and fog node, that subsequently increases the amount of labelled personal local data for the ML model during incremental training. Furthermore, the DISFL framework addresses data privacy by leveraging federated learning, where only the model's knowledge is moved to a global unit, herein referred to as Collective Intelligence Node (CIN). During incremental learning, this would then allow the creation of an immutable chain of data that has to be trained, which in its entirety is tamper-free while increasing trust between parties. With a degree of certainty, this approach counters adversarial manipulation during incremental learning in active learning context at the same time strengthens data privacy, while reducing the computation costs.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3423423.3423425", "Authors": ["Victor R.

Proposed architecture is endorsed by a proof-of-concept implementation, which utilizes smart contracts to ensure the integrity of administration supplemented by intrinsic benefits of blockchain to be distributed and transparent. Despite the rising hype around the blockchain technology that stokes its utilization in different domains, utilizing it for access control purposes is not yet promising. Our implementation results assure using blockchain for administrative access control is propitious, while is not yet appropriate for operational access control, which have been mainly the focus of previously proposed blockchain-based access control works.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3510547.3517921", "Authors": ["Mehrnoosh Shakarami", "James Benson", "Ravi Sandhu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450392297", "nombredePage": "124  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Institute for Cyber Security (ICS) & NSF Center for Security and Privacy Enhanced Cloud Computing (C-SPECC), University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA", "Institute for Cyber Security (ICS) & NSF Center for Security and Privacy Enhanced Cloud Computing (C-SPECC), University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA", "Institute for Cyber Security (ICS) & NSF Center for Security and Privacy Enhanced Cloud Computing (C-SPECC), University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"], "Conference": "Sat-CPS '22: Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3510547", "Total_Citations": "0"},

In this paper, we extend this work by exploring how to operationalise features of conditionality in charitable giving, situated in the context of large international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Building on prior engagements with international aid organisations, we present design considerations and a conceptual architecture supporting real-time, conditional giving for individual and institutional donations. Our architecture leverages properties of distributed-ledger technologies (DLT) to empower donors to (i) attach conditions to their donation, (ii) store funds in a secure, decentralised escrow and (iii) automatically release funds once conditions are met. Unlike prior work that envisions radical disintermediation and the removal of intermediate NGOs using DLT, our work recognises the expertise of NGOs in tackling complex global problems and instead investigates compelling new way for charities to increase transparency and accountability by introducing dynamic pledge controls.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3441000.3441014", "Authors": ["Ludwig Trotter", "Mike Harding", "Peter Shaw", "Nigel Davies", "Chris Elsden", "Chris Speed", "John Vines", "Aydin Abadi", "Josh Hallwright"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450389754", "nombredePage": "764  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computing and Communications Lancaster University, United Kingdom", "School of Computing and Communications Lancaster University, United Kingdom", "School of Computing and Communications Lancaster University, United Kingdom", "School of Computing and Communications Lancaster University, United Kingdom", "Design Informatics University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Design Informatics University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Northumbria University, United Kingdom", "School of Business and Technology University of Gloucestershire, United Kingdom", "Oxfam Australia and RMIT University, Australia"], "Conference": "OzCHI '20: Proceedings of the 32nd Australian Conference on Human-Computer Interaction", "doi": "10.1145/3441000", "Total_Citations": "3"},
{"title": "Towards Achieving the 2030 Vision, the Case study of Automating the Food Production Services during the Hajj Season and Quality Control Using the Blockchain Technology", "date": "13 April 2022", "abstract": "Improving the services provided for the pilgrims is one of the Saudi Arabian government priorities, as well as for each person who works in the agencies of serving them. Food providing is considered one of the main services for the pilgrims. The current food service providers are 3-4 food plants that do not cover the whole number of the needed meals, kitchens, and the local market. In the current situation, the meals are provided under no specific standards or regulations, and the quality assurance process needs to work with several providers. In this paper, we propose a solution for this problem by suggesting the automation of the whole food providing services by establishing several centralized and specialized food plants that work under a single authority, distributed widely to cover a large area of the pilgrims' locations. The plants will be responsible for the food service starting from providing the raw materials up to the delivery of the meals to the performers on time without any compromise in its quality. This is done by applying blockchain technology as a proposed method for quality control on the supply chain to record every transaction and verify the origin of every material used to produce the meals, as well as trace back the source of any problem to its origin. This will ensure the availability of the total number of required meals in time, the meals to be produced under specific standards and specifications, and will digitize the quality assurance process and make it more centralized. The result of simulating the proposed \"to-be\" business model by using the Bizagi platform showed that the proposed model outperformed the current \"as-is\" model by saving 54.46% of the needed total needed time for food providing service. It also showed promising results regarding quality when applying blockchain technology.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3508072.3508096", "Authors": ["Dhefaf Radain", "Saliha Almalki", "Shatha A.

{"title": "Stackelberg Game Based Edge Computing Resource Management for Mobile Blockchain", "date": "26 October 2020", "abstract": "Blockchain can provide a dependable environment for mobile applications. As the core of blockchain, mining consumes a large amount of computing resources, while mobile devices are too resource-limited to perform the mining. Offloading mining computation tasks to an edge computing service provider (ESP) or a cloud computing service provider (CSP) is considered as a feasible solution to mobile blockchain mining. However, the computing resources of the ESP are not unlimited. Therefore, rational edge computing resource management is critical to maximizing the utilities of the ESP and the miners. Most of the existing work assumes that the service provider is an ESP or a CSP, or both. In this paper, we construct a computing offloading model consisting of multiple miners, an ESP, and a CSP, where the ESP and the CSP are independent of each other. We formulate a Stackelberg game with the ESP as the leader and the miners as the followers for optimal pricing-based edge computing resource management. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg game equilibrium and derive the miners' optimal computing resource requests. We then propose an effective golden section based Stackelberg game equilibrium searching algorithm (SES) for resource pricing. We conduct the experiments through simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed computing offloading model and algorithm can achieve high unit service utilities of both the ESP and the end devices.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3393527.3393565", "Authors": ["Yuqi Fan", "Guangming Shen", "Zhifeng Jin", "Donghui Hu", "Lei Shi", "Xiaohui Yuan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450375344", "nombredePage": "220  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology Hefei, Anhui, China", "School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology Hefei, Anhui, China", "School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology Hefei, Anhui, China", "School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology Hefei, Anhui, China", "School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology Hefei, Anhui, China", "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas Denton, TX, USA"], "Conference": "ACM TURC'20: Proceedings of the ACM Turing Celebration Conference - China", "doi": "10.1145/3393527", "Total_Citations": "2"},

With T-Tracer, each party of data delivery embeds its digital fingerprint into the byte sequence of the shared data by generating a tailor-made symbol mapping table, whereby the watermarking can handle any type of data. A blockchain network overlaying all data sharing participants serves as a trusted third party to ensure the credibility of T-Tracer.

However, despite of these research studies, predicting the likelihood of falls still remains as a huge challenge in both medical and IT research domains. Data related to these risk factors being scattered among different healthcare providers can be attributed as a main reason for this challenge. This is further amplified by healthcare providers being reluctant to disseminate the data beyond their entities due to the security and privacy concerns. However, in recent years, blockchain has been proven as a promising technology to address the security and privacy challenges in healthcare data exchange as it provides a shared, immutable, and transparent audit trail for accessing data.

Firstly, all medical institutions are divided by regions, and multiple medical institutions alliances are generated, and the consortium blockchain is formed respectively. The medical metadata is stored on the blockchain, and the medical data block is stored in InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In each consortium blockchain, a small number of authoritative organizations are selected to form a main chain, which is responsible for the cross chain query function among the consortium blockchains. In the query process, the proxy re encryption technology is used to realize the user's access to the patient's medical information. The experimental results show that the model ensures the tamper proof and security of medical data, It realizes the safe sharing of medical data and improves the query efficiency of medical data, When 78.5% of the total number of queries in the same alliance, the cross chain scheme is better than the ordinary scheme.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3488933.3489014", "Authors": ["Li Haohao", "Liu Jianhua"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450384087", "nombredePage": "715  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications,, China", "Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications,, China"], "Conference": "AIPR 2021: 2021 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition", "doi": "10.1145/3488933", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "Secure Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation Scheme in Blockchain-based Medical Environment", "date": "25 August 2020", "abstract": "Blockchain is essentially a form of distributed data storage technology. It is designed to prevent arbitrary manipulation by operators of distributed nodes and contains a list of changes that records the continuously changing data on the participating nodes. Currently, various blockchain-based services are appearing. in particular, blockchain-based medical convergence services are emerging worldwide. In a blockchain-based medical environment, hospitals, departments, doctors and patients must frequently update and use all public and private key pairs to minimize the leakage of personal information. As such, key pairs management is of great importance. To securely manage keys in such a medical environment, hierarchical deterministic wallet is used. Defined as Bitcoin's BIP32 standard, it is currently the most commonly used technology and allows hospitals to easily derive and manage the key of departments, doctors and patients. In addition, if the hospital, which is at the root level, backs up the first seed value, the doctor and patient can easily recover the key in the future, in case it is lost. However, problems have been found with hierarchical deterministic wallets. The attacker can infer the doctor's private key by obtaining doctor's public key, chain code, or the patient's index and private key. In addition, there is a privilege escalation attack that can be acquired up to the department or hospital's private key. Subsequently, an attacker can leak personal information, such as the personal information of doctors or medical records of managed patients. That is why the current BIP32 standard does not include the function to derive lower public keys from the higher public keys. In this scheme, we maintain the functionality removed from BIP32. In addition, we propose a secure scheme of hierarchical deterministic key generation scheme in blockchain-based medical environment by preventing privilege escalation attack.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3409934.3409958", "Authors": ["Tae-Hoon Kim", "Im-Yeong Lee"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377706", "nombredePage": "184  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, South Korea", "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, South Korea"], "Conference": "IECC '20: Proceedings of the 2nd International Electronics Communication Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3409934", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Early work in this area, as well as most of commercial solutions, has adopted a centralized client/server approach, neglecting the multitude of risks that are induced by an unfair control of the server side. This has made the adoption of a decentralized and trust-less framework quintessential to guarantee devices security. Nevertheless, decentralized proposals are hardly applicable due to costs, slowness and privacy issues. In this paper, we make the use of blockchain practical for smart environments by designing HyBloSE, a secure-by-design and lightweight blockchain-based framework, able to run on low-power devices without additional hardware. HyBloSE is built by using Delegated Proof of Authority and a Moving Window Blockchain. We evaluate HyBloSE through a network emulator and real experiments with different Raspberry Pi platforms. Results show that HyBloSE guarantees a higher security level in terms of resiliency to internal and external attacks compared to centralized solutions, with overhead below 0.38s per operation and less than $4 per month for unlimited operations. Furthermore, we show how Proof of Authority is more adapt then Proof of Work in IoT private scenarios.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3410699.3413793", "Authors": ["Gaia Maselli", "Mauro Piva", "Francesco Restuccia"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450380799", "nombredePage": "81  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Rome, Rome, Italy", "University of Rome, Rome, Italy", "Northeastern University"], "Conference": "CryBlock '20: Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains for Distributed Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3410699", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "Determinant factors of intention to adopt blockchain technology across academic libraries", "date": "14 September 2020", "abstract": "Academic libraries experience a lot of pressure due to rapid changes in technology, budget cuts and increasing demand of information services from their clientele. At the same time, libraries are expected to improve their information services at the global level to meet the increasing demands of libraries\u2019 population. Therefore, an effective collaboration in academic libraries is not an option anymore, but a necessity in order to cope with the rapidly changing technologies and external pressures. Blockchain technology because of its capabilities to record transactions and digital interactions in a transparent, secure, resilient, efficient and traceable way across untrusted parties, offers new opportunities for academic libraries\u2019 collaboration. However, due to its infancy stage of development, literature on blockchain technology adoption behavior is lacking, especially in the context of academic libraries. This therefore opens up the opportunities for further research in this area. Based on the technology innovation theory and technology-organisation-environment framework, a conceptual research model has been developed to investigate the determinant factors of intention to adopt blockchain technology in South African academic libraries\u2019 collaborative business processes.

{"title": "Why Do My Blockchain Transactions Fail?: A Study of Hyperledger Fabric", "date": "18 June 2021", "abstract": "Permissioned blockchain systems promise to provide both decentralized trust and privacy. Hyperledger Fabric is currently one of the most wide-spread permissioned blockchain systems and is heavily promoted both in industry and academia. Due to its optimistic concurrency model, the transaction failure rates in Fabric can become a bottleneck. While there is active research to reduce failures, there is a lack of understanding on their root cause and, consequently, a lack of guidelines on how to configure Fabric optimally for different scenarios. To close this gap, in this paper, we first introduce a formal definition of the different types of transaction failures in Fabric. Then, we develop a comprehensive testbed and benchmarking system, HyperLedgerLab, along with four different chaincodes that represent realistic use cases and a chaincode/workload generator. Using HyperLedgerLab, we conduct exhaustive experiments to analyze the impact of different parameters of Fabric such as block size, endorsement policies, and others, on transaction failures. We further analyze three recently proposed optimizations from the literature, Fabric++, Streamchain and FabricSharp, and evaluate under which conditions they reduce the failure rates. Finally, based on our results, we provide recommendations for Fabric practitioners on how to configure the system and also propose new research directions.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3452823", "Authors": ["Jeeta Ann Chacko", "Ruben Mayer", "Hans-Arno Jacobsen"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450383431", "nombredePage": "2969  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany", "Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany", "University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3448016", "Total_Citations": "8"},

In the varied ecosystem of techno-social platforms, blockchain-based online social networks - BOSNs - are gaining momentum since the underlying blockchain offers data validation, data storage, and data decentralization. As data sources, BOSNs provide high-resolution temporal data about the evolution of the social network and on the interactions of users with the platform services. In this study, we focus on a few temporal characteristics, by analyzing the dynamics of the link creation process and the claiming of rewards in the BOSN Steemit. We model blockchain data as a temporal directed network from which we extract the time series characterizing link creation and reward claims. Adopting a user-centric approach, we evaluate the heterogeneity of the time series through the inter-event time distribution, the burstiness, the bursty train size distribution, and the fitting of inter-event times by power law models. The outcomes of the analysis highlight that the above processes show bursty traits typical of human dynamics. However, the two aspects present a few differences concerning the types of models describing their behavior and the time scale of their bursty nature. To sum up, the creation of new relationships and the reward claim dynamics ask for specific models able to reproduce their general bursty traits but taking into account their specificities and relations with other services and mechanisms offered by BOSN platforms.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3462203.3475913", "Authors": ["Cheick Tidiane Ba", "Matteo Zignani", "Sabrina Gaito"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450384780", "nombredePage": "345  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science, University of Milan, Milan, IT", "Department of Computer Science, University of Milan, Milan, IT", "Department of Computer Science, University of Milan, Milan, IT"], "Conference": "GoodIT '21: Proceedings of the Conference on Information Technology for Social Good", "doi": "10.1145/3462203", "Total_Citations": "3"},

Transactions execute different smart contract operations that may have widely varying business importance. In such a setting, we argue that the typically adopted First-In-First-Out ordering mechanism for transactions in a blockchain system, which is a performance-limited resource, is inefficient and unfair. We propose a weighted fair queueing strategy for ordering transactions that can support differentiated quality of service for submitted transactions on the blockchain. The main challenge we address in this paper is to support fair allocation and differentiation in a decentralized manner, as there is no single authority that can facilitate this as in traditional systems.

{"title": "Policy-based Chameleon Hash for Blockchain Rewriting with Black-box Accountability", "date": "08 December 2020", "abstract": "Policy-based chameleon hash is a useful primitive for blockchain rewriting. It allows a party to create a transaction associated with an access policy, while another party who possesses enough rewriting privileges satisfying the access policy can rewrite the transaction. However, it lacks accountability. The chameleon trapdoor holder may abuse his/her rewriting privilege and maliciously rewrite the hashed object in the transaction without being identified. In this paper, we introduce policy-based chameleon hash with black-box accountability (PCHBA). Black-box accountability allows an attribute authority to link modified transactions to responsible transaction modifiers in case of dispute, in which any public user identifies those transaction modifiers from interacting with an access device/blackbox. We first present a generic framework of PCHBA. Then, we present a practical instantiation, showing its practicality through implementation and evaluation analysis.

Specifically, we implement Veritas with Apache Kafka to target CFT application scenarios, and Veritas with Tendermint to target BFT application scenarios.

BigchainDB uses Tender-mint for consensus and provides two flavors: a default implementation with blockchain pipelining and an optimized version that includes blockchain pipelining and parallel transaction validation. Our experimental analysis confirms that CFT designs, which are typically used by distributed databases, exhibit much higher performance than BFT designs, which are specific to blockchains.

Our algorithm uses FSMs or HSMs in order to create smart contract patterns using graphs and then uses pattern recognition to identify which parts of the smart contracts should be considered for moving off-chain. The pattern recognition property used is that once software execution transits into the pattern's entry state, off-chain execution continues until the execution transits into the pattern's exit state, when execution continues on-chain. The software developer reviews each pattern together with information, such as anticipated overhead cost due to off-chain execution, and she is provided with guidance on decision making whether to execute the smart contract pattern under consideration off-chain.

Nowadays with the emergence of business oriented distributed ledger frameworks we can find blockchain (BC) in almost every aspect of our everyday real-life transactions. Starting with supply chain, BC has been used to support and secure education, e-government, real estate, insurance, healthcare and other business cases. Regarding blockchain in supply chain, examples as the Walmart and IBM partnership shows that smart contracts (SC) and cryptocurrencies can disrupt the way suppliers, shippers, retailers and customers trust each other and interact. This paper describes how we applied BC technology in two real-life supply chain scenarios. The first one is for logging and tracing products, showing how we can use SCs to identify the ingredients of food products and how to uniquely identify the food product throughout its shipment from the factory to the customer who purchase it. Important aspects of this route is the transparency of the process as well as the verification of transport. The second one deals with how authentication works for users holding BC identities. The identity of a user is important in order to secure the network, allowing only permissioned parties to access it and perform actions on the data. As long as the network is private and immutable, authenticating and authorizing users is crucial for enforcing the end-to-end security to increase users' trust and protect the confidentiality of data. While exploring these two scenarios we define the actors, the transactions these actors can perform on the systems and we propose the SCs that have to be implemented for these use cases to take advantage of BC's unique characteristics, as immutability and non-repudiation. In addition, we provide sample template SCs for both scenarios.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3368640.3368655", "Authors": ["Sofia Terzi", "Angeliki Zacharaki", "Alexandros Nizamis", "Konstantinos Votis", "Dimosthenis Ioannidis", "Dimitrios Tzovaras", "Ioannis Stamelos"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450372923", "nombredePage": "165  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece", "Centre for Research & Technology Hellas/ITI, Thessaloniki, Greece", "Centre for Research & Technology Hellas/ITI, Thessaloniki, Greece", "University of Nicosia", "Centre for Research & Technology Hellas/ITI, Thessaloniki, Greece", "Centre for Research & Technology Hellas/ITI, Thessaloniki, Greece", "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"], "Conference": "PCI '19: Proceedings of the 23rd Pan-Hellenic Conference on Informatics", "doi": "10.1145/3368640", "Total_Citations": "9"},

To address the TCB bloating problem, hardware vendors have developed mechanisms to enable or facilitate the creation of a trusted execution environment (TEE) in which critical software applications can execute securely in an isolated environment. Even under the circumstance that a host OS is compromised by an adversary, key security properties such as confidentiality and integrity of the software inside the TEEs can be guaranteed. The promise of integrity and security has driven developers to adopt it for use cases involving access control, PKS, IoT among other things. Among these applications include blockchain-related use cases. The usage of the TEEs doesn\u2019t come without its own implementation challenges and potential pitfalls.

{"title": "Blockchain-Based Cross-Organizational Integrated Platform for Issuing and Redeeming Reward Points", "date": "04 December 2019", "abstract": "For the sake of enhancing repurchase rate and customer loyalty, plenty of enterprises have issued reward points. However, as there are more enterprises issuing reward points, customers become less and less interested to collect them. Even though there are companies forming a business alliance to make reward points more attractive, it is usually managed by a central leading company. In other words, there still exists a security concern for a centralized system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based cross-organizational integrated platform (BCOIP) for issuing and redeeming reward points. BCOIP provides customers an electronic reward point system that is easier to collect and manage and could circulate in many enterprises. Besides, since BCOIP deploys the smart contract to operate the reward point and make all point transactions stored on the permissioned blockchain, it provides more interoperability and security to enterprises and more credibility for costumers. Moreover, goods providers joining the BCOIP could not only improve the diversity of the reward market but also reach more costumers. Finally, we conduct two experiments to evaluate the efficiency and stability of the BCOIP. Results indicate that points transactions are stable regardless of the number of parallel processes and the other shows the number of nodes has nothing to do with the efficiency of this system.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3368926.3369676", "Authors": ["Chia-Hung Liao", "Ya-Wen Teng", "Shyan-Ming Yuan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450372459", "nombredePage": "551  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC", "Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC", "Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"], "Conference": "SoICT 2019: Proceedings of the Tenth International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology", "doi": "10.1145/3368926", "Total_Citations": "1"},

{"title": "Research on cross-chain method based on distributed Digital Identity", "date": "07 July 2022", "abstract": "With the rapid development of blockchain technology and increasingly rich application scenarios, it is very important to use cross-chain technology to promote the interconnection between blockchain. Cross-chain data transmission and cross-chain asset transfer are important cross-chain scenarios, which have high requirements for cross-chain transaction efficiency. However, the existing high-performance cross-chain mode side chain and notary mode cannot meet the trust requirements in these scenarios. DID (distributed digital Identity) does not depend on the central identity provider, in distributed scenarios, each user is given the ability to control and use digital identity independently, improve the credibility of side chain and notary mode, and then use high-performance cross-chain mode to meet the requirements of cross-chain transaction efficiency. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of combining distributed digital identity and cross-chain technology, design a cross-chain model based on distributed digital identity, and explain how to introduce distributed digital identity in the key steps of cross-chain interaction, access control, cross-chain transactions and so on. A cross-chain transaction process based on distributed digital identity is formed, including transaction algorithm process, example and cross-chain transaction voucher format based on distributed digital identity. In the experiment, in the case of cross-chain data transmission and cross-chain asset transaction, compared with the current mainstream relay chain mode with high credibility, it is concluded that the cross-chain method based on distributed digital identity has obvious performance advantages under the premise of ensuring trust.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3532640.3532649", "Authors": ["Sihan Liu", "Tong Mu", "Shicheng Xu", "Guangyu He"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450395762", "nombredePage": "177  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Neusoft, China", "Neusoft, China", "Neusoft, China", "Neusoft, China"], "Conference": "ICBCT'22: The 2022 4th International Conference on Blockchain Technology", "doi": "10.1145/3532640", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "A Secure Blockchain based Finance Application", "date": "04 November 2021", "abstract": "Blockchain is undoubtedly one of the most potentially attractive technologies for the organization of financial services. The significance of the Blockchain technology in a banking system can be determined by three main principles that is; Disintermediation, Transparency and Provenance. The DLT (distributed ledger technology) eliminates the need for trust enforcer in the banking management system. This is made possible by the tamper- proof data in the distributed data records and all the participants in the network have the same version of data record with them at all times and it is unalterable. Blockchain promotes a public database record of all the customer transactions and other data, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy system as the customers have a 24x7 real-time access to it. Blockchain keeps an immutable distributed data ledger of transactions and this result in maintaining a lifecycle of the assets and its ownership from its first transaction to the most recent one. It reduces the chances of occurrence of theft, insurance fraud and misselling of the high valued assets or intellectual properties. Blockchain can be implemented in the banking sector for various applications like maintenance of data confidentiality, cheque clearing system, real time money transfer system (digital currency), supply chain finance, insurance, trade finance, KYC (know your customer), cross-border payments/transactions system, monitoring of consortium accounts, auction system and digital asset management. Blockchain technology can hence enable a decentralized solution for the banking ecosystem. The proposed system enables one platform for both the lenders and the borrowers to initiate their money transaction for lending, borrowing and repayment of the loan money. The transactions made throughout, that is, from the start to the last repayment can be viewed easily on a blockchain network thus increasing the transparency and trust of the customers and it resolves any disputes that can arise in the loan system. Along with this, a KYC registry based on blockchain is also proposed which will help in maintaining the KYC details in one platform which can be accessed by various banks for identification and verification of the customer in an easy and faster manner. It will increase the customer satisfaction as there will be no need for the customer to perform a KYC check every time he/she creates a bank account in any bank as the bank can easily access their KYC details from this system.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3474124.3474138", "Authors": ["Urshila Ravindran", "P Raghu Vamsi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450389204", "nombredePage": "483  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, India", "Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, India"], "Conference": "IC3 '21: 2021 Thirteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3-2021)", "doi": "10.1145/3474124", "Total_Citations": "0"},

However, fragmentation unleashed by its underlying concepts hinders different stakeholders from effectively utilizing blockchain-supported services, resulting in the obstruction of its wide-scale adoption. To explore synergies among the isolated frameworks requires comprehensively studying inter-blockchain communication approaches. These approaches broadly come under the umbrella of Blockchain Interoperability (BI) notion, as it can facilitate a novel paradigm of an integrated blockchain ecosystem that connects state-of-the-art disparate blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of studies that comprehensively review BI, which works as a stumbling block in its development. Therefore, this article aims to articulate potential of BI by reviewing it from diverse perspectives. Beginning with a glance of blockchain architecture fundamentals, this article discusses its associated platforms, taxonomy, and consensus mechanisms. Subsequently, it argues about BI\u2019s requirement by exemplifying its potential opportunities and application areas. Concerning BI, an architecture seems to be a missing link. Hence, this article introduces a layered architecture for the effective development of protocols and methods for interoperable blockchains.

Collaborative computing and data slicing are effective methods to improve performance, and they have been widely used in various fields. This paper proposes a tree chain architecture that adds peer-to-peer blockchain to main chain of the Ethereum. When there is a task to be processed in the main chain, the architecture assigns the task to \"branch\" or \"leaf\". The \"branch\" first determines whether the task can be sliced. If the task can be sliced, divide the task into leaf nodes for processing, otherwise let the branch nodes handle. By assigning tasks in this way, it is possible to help the main chain reduce the computational pressure and increase the system throughput.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3378065.3378136", "Authors": ["Tanglin Lin", "Minggang Dong", "Chao Jing"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450361910", "nombredePage": "528  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["College of Information Science and Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi China", "College of Information Science and Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi China", "College of Information Science and Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, Guangxi China"], "Conference": "ICIIP 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 4th International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing", "doi": "10.1145/3378065", "Total_Citations": "0"},

An ETA is a spoofing attack wherein a malicious actor creates a convincing copy of a wireless network Access Point (AP) by duplicating a Service Set ID (SSID) and/or corresponding Message Access Control (MAC) addresses. We introduce TrustedAP: A blockchain-based solution that provides means for clients' (End Users') verification of AP devices as trustworthy using minimal (if any) connected time. We intend to use the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts as a medium for an End User to challenge an AP's trustworthiness. Next, the AP (or AP trust-managing entity) delivers a sound, unique response to both the blockchain via smart contract and the requesting End User by a network channel. The End User validates an AP response using cryptographic integrity-preserving tools alongside an additional capacity for auditing an AP ownership chain. Once validated, clients have a very strong reason to believe that their connection is trustworthy, genuine, and under positive control of the intended public WiFi provider.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3439695", "Authors": ["Phil Fox"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["abstract"], "ISBN": "9781450380621", "nombredePage": "1454  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["SUNY University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"], "Conference": "SIGCSE '21: Proceedings of the 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education", "doi": "10.1145/3408877", "Total_Citations": "1"},

{"title": "An Optimization Scheme for College Teacher Recruitment Management System Based on Blockchain and Text Recognition", "date": "08 February 2022", "abstract": "At present, some colleges and universities use the recruitment system to complete the registration and review of candidates in the recruitment work, but the review work still requires reviewers to spend a lot of time to complete. In addition, candidates submit malicious incorrect registration information to disrupt recruitment, which not only increases the workload of reviewers, but also affects the efficiency of recruitment. Candidates need to upload scanned copies of certification materials (such as ID card, degree certificate, graduation certificate, etc.) when registering. Some candidates are worried about whether the information will be leaked and the reviewers are unfair in reviewing for personal gains. In response to these problems, this article proposes to add text recognition to the recruitment management system of a university teacher to complete the system's automatic registration review. Based on the traceability and non-tampering characteristics of blockchain technology, the security and traceability of registration information are guaranteed. Kind of optimization plan. By analyzing the system process, selecting a third-party API interface to complete text recognition, and combining the simple filtering function of the system to build an automated audit function of the system. Select the candidate's registration information as the traceability object, optimize the system process, write smart contracts, web3.js connect the system and the blockchain. Experiments have proved that the automated audit function is automatically executed after candidates submit the registration form, and the average audit speed is 550ms. Reduce the workload of reviewers and improve recruitment efficiency.

As the blockchain requires a distributed set of machines to agree on a unique block of transactions to be appended to the chain, attackers naturally try to exploit consensus vulnerabilities to double spend. As a result, formally verifying that a blockchain consensus protocol is safe and live is key to mitigate financial losses. Recent progress in mechanical proofs represent the first steps towards verifying blockchain consensus. The parameterized model checking of threshold automata (TAs) has recently proved instrumental in verifying fully asynchronous parts of consensus algorithms, like broadcast algorithms [4].

Specifically, the MPC-DPOS algorithm first selects the 101 candidate nodes from the many nodes of the blockchain system into a logical ring in the first stage, which will participate in the next election process of the proxy nodes to generate new blocks. In addition, since the weights are compared while the shares are not known, Yao's millionaire algorithm is added in the second election process, and the agent nodes are selected to generate new blocks finally.

The proposed method utilizes Bayesian inference-based trust administration to perceived malevolent nodes in Health Smartphone Structures (HSS) for PBFL-ADS. This paper focuses on the specific form of IoMT called HSS because smartphones have been widely used in the healthcare profession. Then, blockchains have been utilized to improve Bayesian trust management's efficacy in detecting hostile nodes in HSSs. The effectiveness of the suggested technique has been assessed, and test results show that blockchain technology helps identify fraudulent nodes with an acceptable workload. The proposed PBFL-ADS method increases the HS2 scenario 1.1, processor utilization at nodes 33.5%, pattern recognition ratio 92.1%.and server utilization 40.1%.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3523283", "Authors": ["Taher M.

{"title": "Outsourced Secure ID3 Decision Tree Algorithm over Horizontally Partitioned Datasets with Consortium Blockchain", "date": "13 March 2021", "abstract": "Due to the capacity of storing massive data and providing huge computing resources, cloud computing has been a desirable platform to assist machine learning in multiple-data-owners scenarios. However, the issue of data privacy is far from being well solved and thus has been a general concern in the cloud-assisted machine learning. For example, in the existing cloud-assisted decision tree classification algorithms, it is very hard to guarantee data privacy since all data owners have to aggregate their data to the cloud platform for model training. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of training a decision tree in the scenario that the distributed data are stored locally in each data owner, where the privacy of the original data can be guaranteed in a more intuitive approach. Specifically, we present a positive answer to the above issue by presenting a privacy-preserving ID3 training scheme using Gini index over horizontally partitioned datasets by multiple data owners. Since each data owner cannot directly divide the local dataset according to the best attributes selected, a consortium blockchain and a homomorphic encryption algorithm are employed to ensure the privacy and usability of the distributed data. Security analysis indicates that our scheme can preserve the privacy of the original data and the intermediate values. Moreover, extensive experiments show that our scheme can achieve the same result compared with the original ID3 decision tree algorithm while additionally preserving data privacy, and calculation time overhead and communication time overhead on data owners decrease greatly.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3442520.3442534", "Authors": ["Ming Yang", "Xuexian Hu", "Jianghog Wei", "Qihui Zhang", "Wenfen Liu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450389037", "nombredePage": "145  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force Information Engineering University, China", "People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force Information Engineering University, China", "People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force Information Engineering University, China", "People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force Information Engineering University, China", "Guilin University Of Electronic Technology, China"], "Conference": "ICCNS 2020: 2020 the 10th International Conference on Communication and Network Security", "doi": "10.1145/3442520", "Total_Citations": "0"},

The reward mechanism grants virtual tokens to the users capable of engaging other users on the platform, which can be either vested in the platform for increased influence or exchanged for fiat currency. The introduction of an economic layer on a social networking platform can seriously influence how people socialize. In this work, we tackle the problem of understanding how this new business model conditions the way people create contents. We performed term frequency and topic modelling analyses over the written contents published on the platforms between 2017 and 2019. This analysis lets us understand the most common topics of the contents that appear in the platform. While personal mundane information still appears, along with contents related to arts, food, travels, and sport, we also see emerging a very strong presence of contents about blockchain, cryptocurrency and, more specifically, on Steemit itself and its users.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3411170.3411248", "Authors": ["Kristina Kapanova", "Barbara Guidi", "Andrea Michienzi", "Kevin Koidl"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450375597", "nombredePage": "286  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland", "Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy", "Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy", "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"], "Conference": "GoodTechs '20: Proceedings of the 6th EAI International Conference on Smart Objects and Technologies for Social Good", "doi": "10.1145/3411170", "Total_Citations": "8"},
{"title": "Plume: Fast Finality Blockchain without Single Failure Point", "date": "29 June 2021", "abstract": " Bitcoin\u2019s slow finality is an important factor preventing it from being widely used in real life. And other public single-chain blockchains have the same problem. In this paper, we propose a practical new protocol called Plume to achieve consensus with fast finality by utilizing a (slow) traditional blockchain. Plume combines the DAG structure and traditional blockchain to increase throughput and speed up confirmation. DAG structure is proposed to increase throughput, but how to construct a secure consensus protocol based on DAG is pretty hard. In Plume, we use the traditional blockchain to generate a randomness which is used to generate fast blocks in DAG. And the order of fast blocks in DAG is dependent on a global clock and a hash function. Same as bitcoin, Plume is a probabilistic protocol. However, due to DAG structure, the creation rate of blocks in Plume can be higher without reducing security. Thus the confirmation time of blocks can be accelerated. This paper also analyzes the probability of confirmation in different conditions and also proves that Plume is secure no matter the randomness from traditional single chain is unbiased or not. At last, this paper simulates performance with 1000 nodes using NS-3. The throughput can be improved to 400 Tps in the case that block size is 100K bytes and time interval of fast block is 1 second. Also the confirmation time can be reduced to within 2 minutes in the case that block size is 10K bytes and time interval is 1 second.

To tackle this problem, in this article, we proposed Consortium Blockchain-based Distributed Secure Search (CBDSS) Scheme over encrypted data in e-Commerce environment. By integrating the blockchain and searchable encryption model, sensitive data can be effectively protected. The consortium blockchain can ensure that only authorized nodes can join the system. To fairly assign nodes for the search tasks, we developed an endorsement strategy in which two agent roles are set up to divide and match the search tasks with the virtual resources according to the load capacity of each node.

Because of its transparency, blockchain is a powerful system for managing storage and computing without a trusted third party. Besides, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) extends public-key encryption by implying access control policies in ciphertexts, making it suitable for protecting the privacy of individual healthcare data in versatile cases. Particularly, we use hospital name, \"date\" and \"department\" as attribute strings in the access control policies. Consequently, based on consortium blockchain and CP-ABE, we propose a patient-centered XDS and a dynamic consent framework. Compared with previous related literature, we make the proposed framework consistent with current practices and achieve favorable criteria, such as data confidentiality, data recoverability and time-aware ciphertext. Further, we conduct comprehensive experiments to show the feasibility and practicality.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3528416.3530228", "Authors": ["Liang Zhang", "Haibin Kan", "Honglan Huang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450393386", "nombredePage": "321  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Fudan University, Shanghai, China", "The Yiwu Research Institute of Fudan University, Zhejiang, China", "Fudan University, Shanghai, China"], "Conference": "CF '22: Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers", "doi": "10.1145/3528416", "Total_Citations": "0"},

More and more businesses owners and individual users rely on information shared on social media and contributed by the crowd for product promotion, decision making, etc. However, it is difficult to evaluate the trustworthiness of such information effectively as the open environment allows all people with different backgrounds and expertise to contribute. Furthermore, it gives chances for malicious users or astroturfers who pursue profits by giving fake reviews or plausible answers, and those who want to build up their business\u2019s reputation without improving quality of good or service. For solving this challenging problem, the paper considers trust as a key element and define it in the expert-based context. Then we propose a Blockchain-based trust model for information sharing in crowd environments. The proposed model uses a weighted consensus mechanism to infer the trustworthiness of shared information basing on reviews from the crowd and defines the accuracy of an agent as the ratio of his winning reviews to his total reviews. The model can reward agents effectively equivalent to his winning reviews. Experimental results show that the proposed model has higher accuracy in defining the trustworthiness of information and obtains better Collective Intelligence than existing models.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3373017.3373037", "Authors": ["Mo Nguyen", "Quan Bai", "Jian Yu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450376976", "nombredePage": "367  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand", "University of Tasmania, Australia", "Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand"], "Conference": "ACSW '20: Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference", "doi": "10.1145/3373017", "Total_Citations": "2"},

Proof of Work (PoW) is the key procedure in blockchain applications, which exhibits the memory-bound characteristic and hinders the performance improvement of blockchain accelerators. In order to mitigate the \"memory wall\" and improve the performance of memory-hard PoW accelerators, using Ethash as an example, we optimize the memory architecture from two perspectives: 1) Hiding memory latency. We propose specialized context switch design to overcome the uncertain cycles of repetitive memory requests. 2) Increasing memory bandwidth utilization. We introduce on-chip memory that stores a portion of the Ethash directed acyclic graph (DAG) for larger effective memory bandwidth, and further propose adopting embedded NOR flash to fulfill the role. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of our optimized memory architecture for Ethash, including number of hash cores, on-chip/off-chip memory technologies and specifications. Based on the design space exploration, we finally provide the guidance for designing the memory-bound PoW accelerator.

In WiVi, Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs) sublease their RF channels through slicing to Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) based on their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the MVNOs independently provide wireless services to their end users. This paper investigates the wireless network virtualization by leveraging both Blockchain technology and machine learning to optimally allocate wireless resources. To eliminate double spending (aka over-committing) of WIPs' wireless resources such as RF channels, Blockchain - a distributed ledger - technology is used where a reputation is used to penalize WIPs with past double spending habit. The proposed reputation based approach helps to minimize extra delay caused by double spending attempts and Blockchain operations. To optimally predict the QoS requirements of MVNOs for their users, linear regression - a machine learning approach - is used that helps to minimize the latency introduced due to (multiple wrong) negotiations for SLAs. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out by using numerical results obtained from simulations. Results have shown that the joint Blockchain and machine learning based approach outperforms the other approaches.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3324921.3328790", "Authors": ["Ashish Adhikari", "Danda B.

Network latency is an important factor affecting users' network experience. Due to the limited processing capacity of a single device node of CPS, the communication relationship between equipment is extremely complicated, and multi-hop device nodes may be passed through in the middle, so designing an efficient routing scheme for CPS is a serious challenge. CPS routing also faces a security crisis. System nodes may send viruses or erroneous results to user equipment, and user equipment may also refuse to pay for routing services to system nodes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a secure routing scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is used to ensure secure transactions between system nodes and user equipment. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is used, and two deep neural networks are used to train intelligent agent to achieve low-latency adaptive traffic scheduling.

A Spam DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) attack is one of the novel attacks that drain the energy source of legitimate nodes and ends up causing the legitimate nodes to suffer from DoS. To address this problem, a mitigation scheme named DIS Spam Attack Mitigation (DISAM) is proposed. The proposed scheme effectively mitigates the effects of the Spam DIS attack on the network\u2019s performance. The experimental results show that DISAM detects and mitigates the attack quickly and efficiently.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3511903", "Authors": ["Amjad Alsirhani", "Muhammad Ali Khan*", "Abdullah Alomari", "Sauda Maryam", "Aiman Younas", "Muddesar Iqbal", "Muhammad Hameed Siqqidi", "Amjad Ali"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1533-5399", "nombredePage": null, "AuthorsFormation": ["Jouf University, Sakaka Aljouf, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Canada", "COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan", "Albaha University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia", "COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan", "COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan", "London South Bank University, United Kingdom", "Jouf University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia", "COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Internet Technology", "doi": "1557-6051", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Different cryptocurrencies preserve privacy at various levels, some of them requiring users to rely on strategies to raise the privacy level to their needs. Among those strategies, we focus on two of them: merge avoidance and mixing services. Such strategies may be adopted on top of virtually any blockchain-based cryptocurrency. In this paper, we show that whereas optimal merge avoidance leads to an NP-hard optimization problem, incentive-compatible mixing services are subject to a certain class of impossibility results. Together, our results contribute to the body of work on fundamental limits of privacy mechanisms in blockchainbased cryptocurrencies.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3466826.3466831", "Authors": ["Jefferson E.

{"title": "RTChain: A Reputation System with Transaction and Consensus Incentives for E-commerce Blockchain", "date": "17 December 2020", "abstract": "Blockchain technology, whose most successful application is Bitcoin, enables non-repudiation and non-tamperable online transactions without the participation of a trusted central party. As a global ledger, the blockchain achieves the consistency of replica stored on each node through a consensus mechanism. A well-designed consensus mechanism, on one hand, needs to be efficient to meet the high frequency of online transactions. For example, the existing electronic payment systems can handle over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Bitcoin can only handle an average of about 3TPS. On the other hand, it needs to have good security and high fault tolerance; that is, in the case when some nodes are captured by adversaries, the network can still operate normally. In this article, we establish a reputation system, called RTChain, to be integrated into the e-commerce blockchain to achieve a distributed consensus and transaction incentives. The proposed scheme has the following advantages. First, an incentive mechanism is used to influence the consensus behavior of nodes and the transaction behavior of users, which in turn influence the reputation scores of both nodes and users. That is, when a node correctly processes a transaction, it will receive the corresponding reputation value as a reward, and the reputation value will be reduced as punishment not only when the node is dishonest and violates the consensus agreement but also the transaction is not completed as required. Just like electronic transactions in the real world, the higher the reputation of the user, the more likely it is to be selected as the transaction partner. A user with a low reputation will be gradually eliminated in our system because it is difficult to complete the transaction. Second, RTChain uses a verifiable random function to generate the leader in each round, which guarantees fairness for all participants and, unlike PoW, does not consume a large amount of computing resources. Then our consensus mechanism selects the nodes with high reputation scores to reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus, thus improving the consensus efficiency, so that RTChain\u2019s throughput can reach 4,000TPS. Third, we built a reputation chain to implement the distributed storage and management of reputation. Finally, our consensus mechanism is secure against existing attacks, such as flash attacks, selfish mining attacks, eclipse attacks, and double spending attacks, and allows nodes that participate in the consensus to fail, as long as the reputation of the failure node does not exceed one-third of the total reputation. We build a prototype of RTChain, and the experimental results show that RTChain is promising and deployable for e-commerce blockchains.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3430502", "Authors": ["You Sun", "Rui Xue", "Rui Zhang", "Qianqian Su", "Sheng Gao"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1533-5399", "nombredePage": "534  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China", "State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China", "State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China", "State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China", "School of Information, Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Internet Technology", "doi": "1557-6051", "Total_Citations": "8"},

The problems of traceability, non-counterfeiting and unique usage of digital coupons fall within this area; many couponing platforms are hence exploring the possibility of addressing the above limitations with blockchain technologies. In view of the foregoing, in this work we analyse and compare several blockchain-based couponing systems. To do so, we first propose a general schema of digital coupon and define the desirable properties of a couponing system. Then, we select a sample of these systems and we examine them, describing their design choices and summarizing their relevant properties.

{"title": "S-BDS: An Effective Blockchain-based Data Storage Scheme in Zero-Trust IoT", "date": "12 February 2022", "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large-scale, heterogeneous, and dynamic distributed network has been formed among IoT devices. There is an extreme need to establish a trust mechanism between devices, and blockchain can provide a zero-trust security framework for IoT. However, the efficiency of the blockchain is far from meeting the application requirements of the IoT, which has become the biggest resistance to the application of the blockchain in the IoT. Therefore, this paper combines sharding to build an effective Blockchain-based IoT data storage scheme (S-BDS). Sharding can solve the problem of blockchain capacity and scalability. While the blockchain provides data immutability and traceability for the IoT, it also brings huge demand for data credibility verification. The communication delay in the IoT system seriously affects the security of the system, while the Merkle proof of traditional blockchain occupies a lot of communication resources. This paper constructs Insertable Vector Commitment (IVC) in the bilinear group and replaces the Merkle tree with IVC to store IoT data in the blockchain. The construct has small-sized proof. It also has the ability to record the number of updates, which can prevent replay-attacks. Experiments show that each block processes 1000 transactions, the proof size of a single data piece is 30% of the original scheme, and proofs from different shards can be aggregated. IVC can effectively reduce communication congestion and improve the stability and security of the IoT system.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3511902", "Authors": ["Jin Wang", "Jiahao Chen", "Neal Xiong", "Osama Alfarraj", "Amr Tolba", "Yongjun Ren"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "1533-5399", "nombredePage": null, "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Fujian University of Technology; School of Computer & Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science & Technology, China", "School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Fujian University of Technology, China", "Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Sul Ross State University, USA", "Computer Science Department, Community College, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia", "Computer Science Department, Community College, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia", "School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, China"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Internet Technology", "doi": "1557-6051", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "A Computational Trust Model Based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain", "date": "13 July 2022", "abstract": "The core component of the blockchain is smart contracts, which are the basis for connecting countless nodes and executing transactions. In smart contracts, trust often replaces trust in the form of proof of workload, proof of identity, proof of authorization, etc. Therefore, in the transaction process of the core chain, the node usually sees a concept of quantity, and does not know the change course of the agent's trust, so that it cannot fully grasp the dynamic process of the agent and the change of the trust evaluation value. The researches of computational trust has deeply affected the global economic and social development, and have been widely used in some large platforms such as ICAO PKD trust platform, EU's eIDAS platform, US FICAM system and so on. The current solution is a combination of limited mathematical models and assumptions that are far from the operational level. Hyperledger has superior performance in data access, invocation, operability, tamperability, traceability and other aspects, and is more suitable for the study of computational trust models. This study introduces the hyperledger technology to construct a computational trust model, and the main factors affecting the computational trust model are analyzed by using the Hyperledger Fabric technology, which is as the form of one to one to correspond to each node in the hyperledger, and realizes the trust transmission of the node, by sorting each node in the consensus chain, and passes. The interface technology realizes the docking between the model and the Hyperledger Fabric system.

The execution time to deploy smart contracts and run their tests is considerable because all transactions must be mined before being added to a new block. This work proposes an approach to reuse the execution of the deployment and the setup of unit test in smart contracts to reduce the execution time of these tests. Experiments have shown a large reduction in the execution time of smart contract unit tests, without breaking the principle of test independency.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3330204.3330225", "Authors": ["Hallan Medeiros", "Patr\u00edcia Vilain", "Vilmar C\u00e9sar Pereira"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450372374", "nombredePage": "623  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Universidade Federal de Santa, Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC", "Universidade Federal de Santa, Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC", "Universidade Federal de Santa, Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC"], "Conference": "SBSI'19: Proceedings of the XV Brazilian Symposium on Information Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3330204", "Total_Citations": "0"},

It extends their range and, as such, productivity and profitability. Drones operating BVLOS include a variety of highly sensitive assets and information that could be subject to unintentional or intentional security vulnerabilities. As a solution, blockchain-based services could enable secure and trustworthy exchange and storage of related data. They also allow for traceability of exchanges and synchronization with other nodes in the network. In this context, we develop simulation models to evaluate different blockchain-based solutions before implementing them in real systems. However, most of these blockchain-based approaches focus on the network and the protocol aspects of drone systems. Few studies focus on the architectural level of on-chip compute platforms of drones. Based on this observation, the contribution of this paper is twofold : (1) a generic blockchain-based service architecture for on-chip compute platforms of drones in a simulated environment, and (2) an illustration of the proposed generic architecture in a simulated environment for authentication.

It is maintained and shared among the participating nodes by utilizing cryptographic primitives. A consensus protocol ensures that all nodes agree on a unique order in which records are appended. However, current blockchain solutions are facing scalability issues. Many methods, such as Off-chain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) solutions, have been proposed to address the issue. However, they have inherent drawbacks, e.g., forming parasite chains. Performance, such as throughput and latency, is also important to a blockchain system. Sharding has emerged as a good candidate that can overcome both the scalability and performance problems in blockchain. To date, there is no systematic work that analyzes the sharding protocols. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a systematic and comprehensive review on blockchain sharding techniques.

{"title": "SoK: tokenization on blockchain", "date": "07 February 2022", "abstract": "Blockchain, a potentially disruptive technology, advances many different applications, e.g., crypto-currencies, supply chains, and the Internet of Things. Under the hood of blockchain, it is required to handle different kinds of digital assets and data. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of numerous applications, and each application may have a distinct representation of digital assets. However, digital assets cannot be directly recorded on the blockchain, and a tokenization process is required to format these assets. Tokenization on blockchain will inevitably require a certain level of proper standards to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. However, due to specific features of digital assets, it is hard to obtain a standard token form to represent all kinds of assets. For example, when considering fungibility, some assets are divisible and identical, commonly referred to as fungible assets. In contrast, others that are not fungible are widely referred to as non-fungible assets. When tokenizing these assets, we are required to follow different tokenization processes. The way to effectively tokenize assets is thus essential and expecting to confront various unprecedented challenges. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive study of the current progress of tokenization on blockchain. First, we explore general principles and practical schemes to tokenize digital assets for blockchain and classify digitized tokens into three categories: fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible. We then focus on discussing the well-known Ethereum standards on non-fungible tokens. Finally, we discuss several critical challenges and some potential research directions to advance the research on exploring the tokenization process on the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study for tokenization on blockchain.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3492323.3495577", "Authors": ["Gang Wang", "Mark Nixon"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450391634", "nombredePage": "256  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Connecticut", "Emerson Automation Solutions"], "Conference": "UCC '21: Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion", "doi": "10.1145/3492323", "Total_Citations": "1"},

Despite recent intensive research on using sharding techniques to enhance the scalability of blockchain systems, existing solutions do not efficiently address cross-shard transactions. In this paper, we introduce SharPer, a scalable permissioned blockchain system. In SharPer, nodes are clustered and each data shard is replicated on the nodes of a cluster. SharPer supports networks consisting of either crash-only or Byzantine nodes. In SharPer, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph and each cluster maintains only a view of the ledger. SharPer incorporates decentralized flattened protocols to establish cross-shard consensus. The decentralized nature of the cross-shard consensus in SharPer enables parallel processing of transactions with nonoverlapping clusters. Furthermore, SharPer provides deterministic safety guarantees. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of SharPer in terms of performance and scalability especially in workloads with a low percentage of cross-shard transactions.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3452807", "Authors": ["Mohammad Javad Amiri", "Divyakant Agrawal", "Amr El Abbadi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450383431", "nombredePage": "2969  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA", "University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA", "University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3448016", "Total_Citations": "11"},

In the proposed scheme, Ethereum smart contracts are created to define the interactions between data owner, data user, and multiple attribute authorities. A data user presents its attributes to different attribute authorities, and after successful validation of attributes, obtains attribute tokens from respective attribute authorities. After collecting enough attribute tokens, a smart contract will be executed to issue secret key to the data user to access the requested object.

In this paper we detail a system designed to ease the burden of compliance for banks within the EU and save their customers time through the secure and permissioned sharing of digital KYC data. In order to share data, banks need a secure system capable of protecting the privacy of both them and their clients. We detail a system which uses blockchain technology and various privacy and security enhancing techniques to provide banks with a fast and secure way to share documents required for know your customer compliance. The system was built to be aligned with the GDPR, meaning each participating bank must have explicit permission for a customer to access one or more of their documents. These permissions are stored on a private blockchain shared by the banks. Moreover, we detail methods to anonymise on-chain data where necessary. The use of a private blockchain to achieve consensus on the veracity of customer-granted permissions to data enables participating banks to trust one another as each permission and request is observed, agreed upon, and stored on-chain.

In the first case, we consider a miner of a stronger blockchain launches 51% attacks on a weaker blockchain, where the two blockchains share the same mining algorithm. In the second case, we consider a miner rents mining power from cloud mining services to launch 51% attacks. As 51% attacks lead to double-spending, the miner can profit from these two attacks.

{"title": "Blurring the Lines between Blockchains and Database Systems: the Case of Hyperledger Fabric", "date": "25 June 2019", "abstract": "Within the last few years, a countless number of blockchain systems have emerged on the market, each one claiming to revolutionize the way of distributed transaction processing in one way or the other. Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance, are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already. These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By implementing parallel transaction processing, Fabric's workflow is highly motivated by optimistic concurrency control mechanisms in classical database systems. This raises two questions: (1)~Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2)~Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our experimental evaluation under the Smallbank benchmark as well as under a custom workload shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by up to a factor of 12x, while decreasing the average latency to almost half.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3299869.3319883", "Authors": ["Ankur Sharma", "Felix Martin Schuhknecht", "Divya Agrawal", "Jens Dittrich"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450356435", "nombredePage": "2106  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany", "Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany", "Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany", "Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3299869", "Total_Citations": "55"},

There is a growing interest in many research groups towards leveraging blockchains to provide IoT data privacy without the need for a centralized data access model. This paper aims to propose a decentralized access model for IoT data, using a network architecture that we call a modular consortium architecture for IoT and blockchains. The proposed architecture facilitates IoT communications on top of a software stack of blockchains and peer-to-peer data storage mechanisms.

Such concerns are triggered by a tension between some unique characteristics of public blockchain systems and some new data subject rights introduced in the GDPR, e.g., the data immutability and the \u201cright to erasure\u201d (a.k.a.\u00a0\u201cthe right to be forgotten\u201d). The aim of this work is to understand how service providers and developers behind public blockchain systems have communicated about such GDPR-related challenges to their users and how the users have perceived such GDPR-related issues. To this end, for 50 public blockchain systems whose corresponding cryptocurrency had a capital market size over $150 million, we analyzed relevant communications and discussions on the following three online channels: blog and forums posts, GitHub repositories, and discussions on Twitter. Our results show that service providers and developers of the selected public blockchain systems did not play an active role in GDPR-related online discussions on Twitter. They also did not communicate with their users about GDPR on their forums and blogs frequently, where we could identify only 56 posts out of 17,821 posts for the period we studied. Our study also reveals that only an extreme minority of the studied systems (4) mentioned GDPR in their GitHub repositories. Our work adds new evidence on the lack of transparency and active communications of the public blockchain sector on the challenging GDPR compliance issue of public blockchain systems.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3433174.3433587", "Authors": ["Zeynep Chousein", "Haci Yakup Tetik", "Rahime Belen Sa\u011flam", "Abdullah B\u00fclb\u00fcl", "Shujun Li"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387514", "nombredePage": "220  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Universitesi, Turkey", "Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Universitesi, Turkey", "University of Kent, UK", "Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Universitesi, Turkey", "University of Kent, UK"], "Conference": "SIN 2020: 13th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks", "doi": "10.1145/3433174", "Total_Citations": "0"},

To elucidate this point, we took the case of India, where multiple beneficiary-oriented programmes are implemented in rural areas of the country targeting about a billion people. Billions of dollars are spent by both Federal Governments and State Governments in undertaking similar exercises for outreach, identification, and enrolment of beneficiaries under various welfare programmes that provide cash transfers, subsidies and other social services to the disadvantaged youth, women and aged in society. Some countries have also undertaken household surveys to identify gaps in demand and the supply of government services. However, limited success has been achieved in adopting such static database as the single source of truth for the identification of deprived households across all government programmes, due to its inherent potential for creating errors of inclusion and exclusion. Another major deterrent in the adoption of such a singular identity associated with socio-economic attribute is the concentration of information and associated risks. Through this paper, an attempt is being made to bridge this \u2018trust deficit\u2019 in governance through the application of distributed ledger technology for social inclusion. We further discuss how government is better placed than the private sector to tap the full potential of Blockchain technology as several public organizations working in the same sector are often controlled by the same parent government department. A mandate from government can give the necessary thrust to reap the benefits of this ecosystem-centric technology. At the last, feasibility, approaches and challenges are analyzed.

As an initial design, a novel theoretical model is proposed to assure the efficacy of the proposed slim chain with specific respect to the dependability from a single transaction's standpoint in a stochastic manner. It is demonstrated that the dependability can be traced with respect to whether the transaction of concern is to write off the chain or read back from off the chain to on-chain, as the transactions writing off the chain are more dependable than reading from off the chain without loss of practicality, as well as the crypto rate and the IPFS rate as IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) is an off-chain storage considered in this research.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3384943.3409435", "Authors": ["Abhilash Kancharla", "Jongho Seol", "Nohpill Park", "Hyeyoung Kim"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper"], "ISBN": "9781450376105", "nombredePage": "223  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA", "Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA", "Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA", "Hongik University, Seoul, South Korea"], "Conference": "BSCI '20: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Symposium on Blockchain and Secure Critical Infrastructure", "doi": "10.1145/3384943", "Total_Citations": "1"},

Users in the early stages of the service are expected to participate in and be active in the service by expecting future price increases in that cryptocurrency. However, the volatility of cryptocurrencies is always intense, and the large volatility may cause users to be more interested in price changes than service activities, which diminishes the incentives for the service activities. In this study, in order to dampen the volatility of cryptocurrencies at the initial stage of their service launch, we assume the case where the service providers make bids to suppress the price changes based on the funds obtained from ICO, and conduct analysis using simulations in artificial market. In order to reproduce the actual price movement in the artificial market, we built an agent model that has the same stylized facts as the price movement of newly listed cryptocurrencies. Then, we introduced a price stabilization agent, and obtained a parameter set that reduces price volatility while suppressing the change in the slope of a simple linear regression compared to the original state using an optimization method. As a result, by introducing the price stabilization agent, we found a parameter set that can reduce the standard division of percentage changes by about 14% from the original price movement, and keep the slope of the simple linear regression trend at a 3.5% change.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3390566.3391679", "Authors": ["Kyohei Shibano", "Ruxin Lin", "Gento Mogi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377676", "nombredePage": "166  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Dept. of Technology Management for Innovation, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Japan", "Dept. of Technology Management for Innovation, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Japan", "Dept. of Technology Management for Innovation, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Japan"], "Conference": "ICBCT'20: Proceedings of the 2020 The 2nd International Conference on Blockchain Technology", "doi": "10.1145/3390566", "Total_Citations": "1"},

{"title": "A Transactional Perspective on Execute-order-validate Blockchains", "date": "31 May 2020", "abstract": "Smart contracts have enabled blockchain systems to evolve from simple cryptocurrency platforms to general transactional systems. A new architecture called execute-order-validate has been proposed in Hyperledger Fabric to support parallel transactions. However, this architecture might render many invalid transactions when serializing them. This problem is further exaggerated as the block formation rate is inherently limited due to other factors beside data processing, such as cryptography and consensus. Inspired by optimistic concurrency control in modern databases, we propose a novel method to enhance the execute-order-validate architecture, by reordering transactions to reduce the abort rate. In contrast to existing blockchains that adopt database's preventive approaches which might over-abort serializable transactions, our method is theoretically more fine-grained: unserializable transactions are aborted before reordering and the rest are guaranteed to be serializable. We implement our method in two blockchains respectively, FabricSharp on top of Hyperledger Fabric, and FastFabricSharp on top of FastFabric. We compare the performance of FabricSharp with vanilla Fabric and three related systems, two of which are respectively implemented with one standard and one state-of-the-art concurrency control techniques from databases. The results demonstrate that FabricSharp achieves 25% higher throughput compared to the other systems in nearly all experimental scenarios.

{"title": "Vulnerable Smart Contract Detection by Means of Model Checking", "date": "30 May 2022", "abstract": "We are recently witnessing an exponential use of blockchain technology since information infrastructures are increasingly moving from the concept of centralisation to the decentralization ones. Blockchain technology is strictly related to the exchange of sensitive information, and its massive adoption is corresponding to interest from attackers. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect whether a Smart Contract (i.e. a contract between two parties concerning the exchange of goods and services, it is executed automatically and is governed by a source code written by a developer, contains clearly conditions accepted by both parties and resides on a distributed and decentralised network of computers) exhibits vulnerability. The proposed method relies on model checking and, through the adoption of \u03bc-Calculus rules, is aimed to detect four different vulnerabilities on Smart Contracts modeled as automata. We preliminary evaluate the proposed method on a dataset composed by 40 (vulnerable and legitimate) contracts, by obtaining a precision ranging from 0.98 to 1 and a recall equal to 1, confirming that the proposed method can be promising in vulnerable Smart Contract detection.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3494106.3528672", "Authors": ["Giuseppe Crincoli", "Giacomo Iadarola", "Piera Elena La Rocca", "Fabio Martinelli", "Francesco Mercaldo", "Antonella Santone"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450391757", "nombredePage": "153  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Institute for Informatics and Telematics, CNR, Pisa, Italy", "Institute for Informatics and Telematics, CNR, Pisa, Italy", "Institute for Informatics and Telematics, CNR, Pisa, Italy", "Institute for Informatics and Telematics, CNR, Pisa, Italy", "University of Molise & Institute for Informatics and Telematics, CNR, Campobasso, Italy", "University of Molise, Campobasso, Italy"], "Conference": "BSCI '22: Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Symposium on Blockchain and Secure Critical Infrastructure", "doi": "10.1145/3494106", "Total_Citations": "0"},

In modern factory, number of machineries are pipelined into assembly/production lines which may merge and branch to meet the procedure requirements. Each machine on the assembly line generates huge amount of sensing data and manufacturing data. However, many manufacturing system are not ready to manage big data. This paper aims on developing the distributed traceability system with Blockchain technology on IoT devices in order to improve the stability of the factory production line, to reduce defect rate and to bring the operational performance to a new level. Without depending on centralized storage, it is a robust, truly distributed peer-to-peer system and capable of node failure tolerance. With better scalability and data interaction, this distributed ledger network enables the use of data collection with security and potential of public traceability system protocol which allows multiple factories to participate, build an ecosystem of traceability together.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3338840.3355646", "Authors": ["Chi-Sheng Shih", "Kai-Wei Yang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450368438", "nombredePage": "323  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan", "National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"], "Conference": "RACS '19: Proceedings of the Conference on Research in Adaptive and Convergent Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3338840", "Total_Citations": "5"},
{"title": "Fluid: A Blockchain based Framework for Crowdsourcing", "date": "25 June 2019", "abstract": "Recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as a new computing paradigm to solve problems that need human intrinsic, such as image annotation. However, there are two limitations in existing crowdsourcing platforms, i.e. non-transparent incentive mechanism and isolated profiles of workers, which harms the interests of both requesters and workers. Meanwhile, Blockchain technology introduces a solution to build a transparent, immutable data model in the Byzantine environment. Moreover, Blockchain systems (e.g. Ethereum) can also support the Tuning-complete script called smart contracts. Thus, we are motivated to use the feature of the transparent data model and smart contract in Blockchain to address the two limitations. Based on the proposed solutions, we have designed a Blockchain based framework which supports foundations of general crowdsourcing platforms. In addition, our framework also has following novel features: (1) it provides the transparent incentive mechanisms; (2) it supports a trusted worker's profile sharing in a cross-platform mode.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3299869.3320238", "Authors": ["Siyuan Han", "Zihuan Xu", "Yuxiang Zeng", "Lei Chen"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450356435", "nombredePage": "2106  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3299869", "Total_Citations": "18"},

Despite the significantly improved scalability claimed by several high-profile blockchain projects, there has been little effort to understand how their transactional throughput is being used. In this paper, we examine recent network traffic of three major high-scalability blockchains---EOSIO, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL)---over a period of seven months. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes. In particular, 96% of the transactions on EOSIO were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless token; on Tezos, 76% of throughput was used for maintaining consensus; and over 94% of transactions on XRPL carried no economic value. We also identify a persisting airdrop on EOSIO as a DoS attack and detect a two-month-long spam attack on XRPL.

By integrating the operation characteristics of controllable load users and fully considering the purchasing and selling electricity demand information between different subclasses of users and load agents, two types of decision model functions of controllable load users and load agents are designed. Based on the basic principle of income optimization, a block chain node model is established considering operation and maintenance cost and operation efficiency.

However, a serious underlying problem still exists in the blockchain system - data bloating. In the blockchain system, each (full) node must store the full data set in blockchain history, incurring significant storage pressure in the initial synchronization process and the following maintenance of the blockchain system. Data bloating is a challenging problem to be confronted in the immediate future of blockchain. To address this problem, in this paper, we introduce the BC-Store framework that deploys a data accessing model on an IPFS-cluster system to classify the hot and cold blockchain data. The hot data are stored in the local cache, whereas the cold data are stored in the IPFS cluster, thereby substantially shortening the blockchain initial synchronization time and saving a considerable amount of data storage. Empirical experimentation shows that our framework can reduce the local storage size from over 265GB to 4GB with a hit ratio of 77% for Bitcoin without significant performance degradation with the whole data shared in an IPFS cluster.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3409934.3409940", "Authors": ["I-Te Chou", "Hung-Han Su", "Yu-Ling Hsueh", "Chih-Wen Hsueh"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377706", "nombredePage": "184  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering; Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations (AIM-HI), National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering; Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations (AIM-HI), National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering; Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations (AIM-HI), National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan", "Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"], "Conference": "IECC '20: Proceedings of the 2nd International Electronics Communication Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3409934", "Total_Citations": "4"},

In this paper, we perform a preliminary investigation on this extensive Ethereum P2P system with a comprehensive measurement method combining active and passive methods. We gather Ethereum nodes information by active method for nodes crawling and verification, and we use the passive network traffic monitoring for routing data gathering. After a period of data collection for more than one month, we get a massive data set that has more than 50 million routing data entries. This data set allows us to gain knowledge on the Ethereum network scale and to derive mathematical characteristics of overlay network structure. By analyzing the data set comprehensively, we find that the Ethereum network exhibits both small-world and scale-free characteristics.

{"title": "Economic Analysis of Decentralized Exchange Market with Transaction Fee Mining", "date": "30 May 2022", "abstract": "Blockchain-based Web 3.0, denoting the next-generation Internet, has attracted attention from academia and industry. However, the open-source application and the decentralized storage of users' interaction data break down the algorithm and data barriers, resulting in more fierce competition among service providers. To cope with the competition, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the financial infrastructures of Web 3.0, adopt the transaction fee mining mechanism, which refunds the transaction fees to users in the form of governance tokens. However, the ratio of governance tokens a DEX decides to give to users would affect the enthusiasm of users to participate, which has not been discussed yet. In this paper, we establish the DEX market with transaction fee mining and formulate our model based on the Hotelling model. Besides, we propose a two-stage game to formulate the interaction between DEXs and users and derive the equilibriums under different conditions of two parameters: the transaction cost difference and users' stickiness. We show that though the service provider with a lower transaction cost can win the market, users' stickiness can offset the market advantage. Thus, incentivizing users with transaction fee mining has become a crucial strategy in the duopoly competition.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3494106.3528677", "Authors": ["Hongbo Zhang", "Sizheng Fan", "Zhixuan Fang", "Wei Cai"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450391757", "nombredePage": "153  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen & Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, Shenzhen, China", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen & Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, Shenzhen, China", "Tsinghua University & Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute, Beijing & Shanghai, China", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen & Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, Shenzhen, China"], "Conference": "BSCI '22: Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Symposium on Blockchain and Secure Critical Infrastructure", "doi": "10.1145/3494106", "Total_Citations": "0"},

To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy for practical use. More importantly, the approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes even at the moment of its creation. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 400 Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum.

The results show that the demand for cold chain food in Hebei Province is mainly domestic food and supplemented by imported food. Cold chain poultry is the main need and other cold chain food is supplement. The flow of imported cold chain food is mainly from the surrounding provinces and cities. Furthermore, in the process of tracing the positive commodities, it is found that there are four main modes of commodity circulation in Hebei Province, namely, family model from farmer, wholesale market, new retail and multi-level sales model.

There is an increasing demand for querying the data stored in a blockchain database. To ensure query integrity, the user can maintain the entire blockchain database and query the data locally. However, this approach is not economic, if not infeasible, because of the blockchain's huge data size and considerable maintenance costs. In this paper, we take the first step toward investigating the problem of verifiable query processing over blockchain databases. We propose a novel framework, called vChain, that alleviates the storage and computing costs of the user and employs verifiable queries to guarantee the results' integrity. To support verifiable Boolean range queries, we propose an accumulator-based authenticated data structure that enables dynamic aggregation over arbitrary query attributes. Two new indexes are further developed to aggregate intra-block and inter-block data records for efficient query verification.

{"title": "BOREALIS: Building Block for Sealed Bid Auctions on Blockchains", "date": "05 October 2020", "abstract": "We focus on securely computing the ranks of sealed integers distributed among n parties. For example, we securely compute the largest or smallest integer, the median, or in general the kth-ranked integer. Such computations are a useful building block to securely implement a variety of sealed-bid auctions. Our objective is efficiency, specifically low interactivity between parties to support blockchains or other scenarios where multiple rounds are time-consuming. Hence, we dismiss powerful, yet highly-interactive MPC frameworks and propose BOREALIS, a special-purpose protocol for secure computation of ranks among integers. BOREALIS uses additively homomorphic encryption to implement core comparisons, but computes under distinct keys, chosen by each party to optimize the number of rounds. By carefully combining cryptographic primitives, such as ECC Elgamal encryption, encrypted comparisons, ciphertext blinding, secret sharing, and shuffling, BOREALIS sets up systems of multi-scalar equations which we efficiently prove with Groth-Sahai ZK proofs. Therewith, BOREALIS implements a multi-party computation of pairwise comparisons and rank zero-knowledge proofs secure against malicious adversaries. BOREALIS completes in at most 4 rounds which is constant in both bit length l of integers and the number of parties n. This is not only asymptotically optimal, but surpasses generic constant-round secure multi-party computation protocols, even those based on shared-key fully homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, our implementation shows that BOREALIS is very practical. Its main bottleneck, ZK proof computations, is small in practice. Even for a large number of parties (n=200) and high-precision integers (l=32), computation time of all proofs is less than a single Bitcoin block interval.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3320269.3384752", "Authors": ["Erik-Oliver Blass", "Florian Kerschbaum"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450367509", "nombredePage": "957  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Airbus, Munich, Germany", "University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"], "Conference": "ASIA CCS '20: Proceedings of the 15th ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3320269", "Total_Citations": "3"},

{"title": "An experimental framework for investigating hashgraph algorithm transaction speed", "date": "10 November 2019", "abstract": "Power grids around the world have experienced a growing number of malicious cyber attacks. This paper provides an overview of recent use of the Hyperledger Fabric distributed operating system to prototype use of a permissioned blockchain consensus algorithm to trust shared state estimation and control data and another effort to alter local sensor data to destroy the integrity of the shared data. The paper also provides justification for an experiment to prototype use of Babble, a peer-to-peer network plugin using the hashgraph consensus algorithm, to share the state estimation and control data through transactions recorded in a hashgraph. A key claim of the hashgraph documentation, which is unsubstantiated without a proper academic analysis, is that the algorithm is asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (ABFT). Also, while the Hyperledger Fabric implementation supports thousands of transactions per second, the hashgraph algorithm documentation claims orders of magnitude more. Our experiment seeks to measure the hashgraph transaction speed and determine its suitability for improving the resilience of wide area control of the smart grid. The previous resilience research of the Anomaly Detection of Cyber Physical Systems (ADCPS) team includes research into inadvertent cyber and physical failures as well as malicious attacks.

The PoW method is uneconomical and the PoS method can be easily monopolized by a few people. To cope with this issue, this paper introduces a Proof-of-Probability (PoP) method. The PoP is a method where each node sorts the encrypted actual hash as well as a number of fake hash, and then the first node to decrypt actual hash creates block. In addition, a wait time is used when decrypting one hash and then decrypting the next hash for restricting the excessive computing power competition. In addition, the centralization by validaters with many stakes can be avoided in the proposed PoP method.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3196494.3201592", "Authors": ["Sungmin Kim", "Joongheon Kim"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["poster"], "ISBN": "9781450355766", "nombredePage": "866  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea", "Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"], "Conference": "ASIACCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3196494", "Total_Citations": "8"},

This paper proposes the EBTree, an index for Ethereum blockchain Data, and implements it based on Ethereum client (Geth1.8). With the properties of B+ tree, EBTree could support real-time top-k, range, equivalent search on Ethereum blockchain data. Besides, EBTree takes up relatively small s-torage space because it only stores the identifiers of blockchain data. Meanwhile, considering of the time intervals of mining block and synchronizing data from Ethereum network, the time of insertion in EBTree has little influence on the performance of Ethereum client.

{"title": "BloTISRT: Blockchain-based Threat Intelligence Sharing and Rating Technology", "date": "04 January 2021", "abstract": "Computer and network technology is developing rapidly, meanwhile various cyber security incidents have occurred frequently. New vulnerabilities and many new security risks have emerged endlessly, which have caused serious threats to cyber security and business security. So the role and value of threat intelligence are increasing. However, there are still some problems of threat intelligence. The threat intelligence information can be tampered in the existing sharing mechanism. At the same time, there is no corresponding feedback mechanism for the quality of the threat intelligence information provided by the intelligence providers. There is a lack of credible judgment and corresponding incentive mechanism for threat intelligence providers. So, in order to solve these problems, a blockchain-based threat intelligence sharing and rating technology is proposed in this paper. Based on the characteristics of blockchain such as openness, consensus, autonomy and decentralization, trustlessness, non-tampering and traceability, the paper uses blockchain technology to build blocks of threat intelligence information, including IP address information, domain name information, URLs Information, security incident information, vulnerability information, threat intelligence source, user's evaluation, credibility of threat intelligence, contribution rate of threat intelligence, credibility of threat intelligence sources and contribution rate of threat intelligence sources. A threat intelligence sharing and rating system based on blockchain is designed in the paper, and the corresponding threat intelligence sharing method and rating method based on blockchain are given. It also proposes the smart contract for the threat intelligence sharing and rating in the paper. It can acquire and analyze the latest and most valuable threat intelligence information timely and effectively, so as to perform protection and emergency response timely, and promote the continuous and effective development of the closed loop of the entire threat intelligence ecosystem.

To verify the correctness and security of the method, we built a complete prototype system based on the Hyperledger Fabric license chain and performed rigorous evaluations on the indicators of physical resource consumption and performance using the Hyperledger Caliper evaluation model.

Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3299815.3314433", "Authors": ["Brian Khieu", "Melody Moh"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450362511", "nombredePage": "295  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Department of Computer Science, San Jose State University, San Jose, California, USA", "Department of Computer Science, San Jose State University, San Jose, California, USA"], "Conference": "ACM SE '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Southeast Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3299815", "Total_Citations": "4"},

However, the most IoT devices and protocols were not designed with security in mind, and economic and energyconsumption constraints make the implementation of security measures a non-trivial problem. One of the most used messaging protocol in IoT, which is MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), leaves to developers the task to implement security, as native security services provided by the protocol are very weak. This paper focuses on MQTT authentication, which is definitely insecure in the protocol, even though the implementations can combine MQTT with other mechanisms to obtain a suitable level of security. The aim of the present work is to propose an innovative OTP-authentication scheme for MQTT which uses Ethereum to implement an independent logic channel for the second-factor authentication. The implementation of the proposed scheme relies on the trusted behavior of smart contracts and adopts suitable strategies to preserve the privacy of users.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3386164.3389095", "Authors": ["Francesco Buccafurri", "Celeste Romolo"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450376617", "nombredePage": "397  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["DIIES Dept., University of Reggio Calabria, Feo di Vito, Reggio Cal., Italy", "DIIES Dept., University of Reggio Calabria, Feo di Vito, Reggio Cal., Italy"], "Conference": "ISCSIC 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 3rd International Symposium on Computer Science and Intelligent Control", "doi": "10.1145/3386164", "Total_Citations": "5"},
{"title": "FL-MAB: client selection and monetization for blockchain-based federated learning", "date": "06 May 2022", "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution for training using data collected from heterogeneous sources (e.g., mobile devices) while avoiding the transmission of large amounts of raw data and preserving privacy. Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that the integration of blockchain and smart contract technologies to FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present FL-MAB (FL- Multi-Auction using Blockchain), a client selection mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. FL-MAB employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract. This allows FL-MAB to measure the relative contribution of each client by calculating a Shapley value, and allocating rewards accordingly. We have implemented FL-MAB using Solidity and tested on the Ethereum blockchain with various popular datasets. Our results show that FL-MAB outperforms existing baseline schemes by improving accuracy and reducing the no. of FL rounds.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3477314.3507050", "Authors": ["Zahra Batool", "Kaiwen Zhang", "Matthew Toews"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450387132", "nombredePage": "2099  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada", "\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada", "\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"], "Conference": "SAC '22: Proceedings of the 37th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3477314", "Total_Citations": "1"},

Since the number of \"things\" is expected to soon surpass human population, control and automation of IoT devices has received considerable attention from academia and industry. Cross-platform collaboration is highly desirable for better user experience due to fragmentation of user needs and vendor products with time. Centralized approaches have been used to build federated trust among platforms and devices, but limit diversity and scalability. We propose a decentralized trust framework, called IoT Passport, for cross-platform collaborations using blockchain technology. IoT Passport is motivated by the familiar use of passports for international travel but with greater dynamism. It enables platforms to establish arbitrary trust relations with each other containing specific rules for intended collaborations, enforced by a combination of smart contracts. Each interaction among devices is signed by the participants and recorded on the blockchain. The records are utilized as attributes for authorization and as proofs of incentive plans. This approach incorporates the preferences of participating platforms and end users, and opens new avenues for collaborative edge computing as well as research on blockchain-based access control mechanism for IoT environments.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3322431.3326327", "Authors": ["Bo Tang", "Hongjuan Kang", "Jingwen Fan", "Qi Li", "Ravi Sandhu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450367530", "nombredePage": "243  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Sichuan Changhong Electric Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China", "Sichuan Changhong Electric Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China", "Sichuan Changhong Electric Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China", "Tsinghua University, Beijing, China", "University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"], "Conference": "SACMAT '19: Proceedings of the 24th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies", "doi": "10.1145/3322431", "Total_Citations": "43"},

These platforms are autonomously managed by users using decentralized consensus protocols in a cryptocurrency ecosystem. The deep integration of social networks and blockchains in these platforms provides potential for numerous cross-domain research studies that are of interest to both the research communities. However, it is challenging to process and analyze large volumes of raw Steemit data as it requires specialized skills in both software engineering and blockchain systems and involves substantial efforts in extracting and filtering various types of operations. To tackle this challenge, we collect over 38 million blocks generated in Steemit during a 45 month time period from 2016/03 to 2019/11 and extract ten key types of operations performed by the users. The results generate SteemOps, a new dataset that organizes more than 900 million operations from Steemit into three sub-datasets namely (i) social-network operation dataset (SOD), (ii) witness-election operation dataset (WOD) and (iii) value-transfer operation dataset (VOD).

Service discovery aims to leverage location information and trust evidence scattered in a variety of multimedia applications to find trusted IoMT devices that can provide specific service in target areas. However, the eavesdropping and tampering to these sensitive IoMT data during the trust propagation process invalidate the service discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose Secure Service Discovery (SSD) for IoMT using cross-blockchain-enabled fog computing. To resist the tampering and eavesdropping during the trust propagation process, a scalable cross-blockchain structure consisting of multiple parallel blockchains is first proposed based on fog, in which different parallel blockchains can be orchestrated to propagate encrypted location information and trust evidence of different applications. Moreover, to enable a cross-blockchain structure to leverage encrypted location information and trust evidence to find trusted IoMT devices in preset areas, a novel privacy-preserving range query is proposed to query and aggregate trust evidence.

IoT connects billions of devices that collect data from the physical environment, which are pre-processed at the edge and then forwarded to processing services at the core of the infrastructure, on top of which cloud-based applications are built and provided to mobile end users. IoT comes with important advantages in terms of applications and added value for its users, making their world smarter and simpler. These advantages, however, are mitigated by the difficulty of guaranteeing IoT trustworthiness, which is still in its infancy. IoT trustworthiness is a must especially in critical domains (e.g., health, transportation) where humans become new components of an IoT system and their life is put at risk by system malfunctioning or breaches. In this article, we put forward the idea that trust in IoT can be boosted if and only if its automation and adaptation processes are based on trustworthy data. We therefore depart from a scenario that considers the quality of a single decision as the main goal of an IoT system and consider the trustworthiness of collected data as a fundamental requirement at the basis of a trustworthy IoT environment. We therefore define a methodology for data collection that filters untrusted data out according to trust rules evaluating the status of the devices collecting data and the collected data themselves. Our approach is based on blockchain and smart contracts and collects data whose trustworthiness and integrity are proven over time. The methodology balances trustworthiness and privacy and is experimentally evaluated in real-world and simulated scenarios using Hyperledger fabric blockchain.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3418686", "Authors": ["Claudio A.

However, existing sharding-based consensus algorithms are not sufficiently designed for distributing miners and transactions to shards in a fair and secure manner, which would make the blockchain systems vulnerable to several attacks. To overcome such limitations of the existing sharding-based consensus protocols, we present a new sharding-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocol using fair and dynamic sharding management. To show the security of the proposed consensus protocol, we numerically analyze attack probabilities and found that the proposed protocol is secure when the number of shards is less than or equal to 6.

Various other mining protocols have been suggested, including proof of stake, in which a miner's chance of adding the next block is proportional to her current balance.

{"title": "DIV: Resolving the Dynamic Issues of Zero-knowledge Set Membership Proof in the Blockchain", "date": "18 June 2021", "abstract": "Zero-knowledge set membership (ZKSM) proof is widely used in blockchain to enable private membership attestation. However, existing mechanisms do not fully consider dynamic issues in the blockchain scenario. Particularly, frequent addition/removal of set elements, not only brings the significant cost to keep public parameters up to date to provers and verifiers but also affects mechanism efficiency (e.g., generation time of the proof and verification, etc.). In this paper, we propose DIV to shard elements on blockchain into independent subsets with the same cardinality to reduce the effect of dynamic issues. However, due to the diverse proof frequency, an improper element-set assignment can result in frequently used elements being easily inferred and corrupted. Thus, we formalize the assignment problem under both element addition and removal cases as two optimization problems and prove their NP-hardness. For each problem, we consider two cases if each element proof frequency is known in advance by the set maintainer or not, and propose solutions with theoretical guarantees. We implement DIV on both Merkle tree and RSA-based ZKSM mechanisms to evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness and apply DIV on a ZKSMbased application named zkSync to demonstrate its applicability. Results show that DIV can achieve O(1) time/space cost on ZKSM under dynamic situations while protecting the information about frequently used elements. It also notably reduces the system latency of zkSync.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3457248", "Authors": ["Zihuan XU", "Lei Chen"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450383431", "nombredePage": "2969  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China", "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3448016", "Total_Citations": "2"},

Most existing social networks follow a centralized system model, which despite storing valuable information of users, arise many critical concerns such as content ownership and over-commercialization. Recently, decentralized social networks, built primarily on blockchain technology, have been proposed as a substitution to eliminate these concerns. Since decentralized architectures are mature enough to be on par with the centralized ones, decentralized social networks are becoming more and more popular. Decentralized social networks can offer both common options like writing posts and comments and more advanced options such as reward systems and voting mechanisms. They provide rich eco-systems for the influencers to interact with their followers and other users via staking systems based on cryptocurrency tokens. The vast and valuable data of the decentralized social networks open several new directions for the research community to extend human behavior knowledge. However, accessing and collecting data from these social networks is not easy because it requires strong blockchain knowledge, which is not the main focus of computer science and social science researchers. Hence, our work proposes the SoChainDB framework that facilitates obtaining data from these new social networks. To show the capacity and strength of SoChainDB, we crawl and publish Hive data - one of the largest blockchain-based social networks. We conduct extensive analyses to understand the insight of Hive data and discuss some interesting applications, e.g., game, non-fungible tokens market built upon Hive.

{"title": "PoTN: A Novel Blockchain Consensus Protocol with Proof-of-Trust Negotiation in Distributed IoT Networks", "date": "15 November 2019", "abstract": "As one of the fundamental characteristics of distributed IoT networks, blockchain has attracted tremendous interests from both the academics and industries. Recently, the key to support distributed IoT networks through blockchain is the consensus protocol with multi-miners selection. However, most of them are fixed-miners based, and thus offering opportunities for attackers to launch DoS attack against the fixed miners or manipulate the creation of blocks by bribing the fixed miners. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus protocol called proof-of-trust negotiation (PoTN). With negotiation rules, trust management is introduced to evaluate the trustworthiness of miners. In this basis, the random-honest miners selection can be achieved by the design of trusted random selection algorithm on the miner team. Simulation results show that PoTN is more effective than traditional consensus protocols in block creation.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3338507.3358613", "Authors": ["Jingyu Feng", "Xinyu Zhao", "Guangyue Lu", "Feng Zhao"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450368384", "nombredePage": "65  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China", "Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China", "Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China", "Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China"], "Conference": "IoT S&P'19: Proceedings of the 2nd International ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy for the Internet-of-Things", "doi": "10.1145/3338507", "Total_Citations": "3"},

However, since interoperability and scalability, due to high and capped (in particular cases) transaction latency are deep-rooted in the architecture of blockchain technology, they are by default inherited in any blockchain based applications. Lightning Network (LN) is one of the supporting technologies developed to eliminate this impediment of blockchain technology by facilitating instantaneous transfers of cryptos. Since the potentials of LN is still relatively unknown, this paper investigates the current states of development along with possible non-monetary usage of LN, especially in settlement coloured coins such as securities, as well as creation of new business models based on Lightning Applications (LApps) and microchannel payments as well as micro-trades.

The best known example of distributed ledger is perhaps the Bitcoin blockchain, which maintains a consistent history of financial transactions organized as a hashed chain of blocks. Distributed ledgers can be public, i.e., accessible by everyone, or private, i.e., accessible only by a given consortium of parties. In this paper, we explore the technological possibilities of applying Identity-Based Encryption and Attribute-Based Encryption to distributed ledgers. We introduce the novel concept of Virtual Private Ledger. A Virtual Private Ledger is a private distributed ledger embedded in a public cryptocurrency ledger by means of cryptography. A Virtual Private Ledger provides for the same confidentiality and integrity of a private distributed ledger, but without its high operational costs. In particular, nodes that maintain the ledger do not have to be always online to trust the order and the integrity of the records. We analytically show that Virtual Private Ledgers can be implemented over many existing cryptocurrency ledgers like Ethereum, EOS.IO, IOTA, XRP. Different cryptocurrencies lead to different trade-offs between the Virtual Private Ledger max record size, cost, validation time, and max consortium members.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3331076.3331083", "Authors": ["Antonio Arena", "Pericle Perazzo", "Gianluca Dini"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450362498", "nombredePage": "364  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Pisa, Pisa (Italy)", "University of Pisa, Pisa (Italy)", "University of Pisa, Pisa (Italy)"], "Conference": "IDEAS '19: Proceedings of the 23rd International Database Applications & Engineering Symposium", "doi": "10.1145/3331076", "Total_Citations": "3"},

Furthermore, smart contracts can interact with each other via message exchange to access data that are stored on them and to call each others' methods. In this paper, we propose a two-level hierarchical architecture that is composed of two types of smart contracts: custodian and client. A custodian contract can deploy on-demand client contract, access their data and call their methods to perform specific updates. Moreover, we develop a framework to allow client contracts to share common variables among all or partial group of the contracts, which may only be mutated by its creator, custodian contracts.

In these times, it is essential to provide emergency last-mile delivery to disaster-affected populations using connected delivery trucks; however, this gives rise to several challenges. There is an unpredictable demand for resources and the need for fault-tolerant path planning in case the trucks are subjected to attack or breakdowns. There is also the need to track resources to ensure no theft or maldistribution during critical situations. To achieve these objectives, we use a hybrid UAV-Truck architecture for last-mile relief distribution. To increase the delivery operation's robustness, we propose a Self-Optimizing StreamChain (SOSChain) that tracks and controls the status of trucks and their onboard resources. During failure scenarios, the use of information in the SOSChain enables other vehicles to optimally re-route and redistribute resources from damaged vehicles. Extensive simulation shows that SOSChain achieves over 25% improvement in throughput and up to 50% reduction in ordering latency compared to StreamChain approach in a simulated disaster environment with up to 50% vehicle failure rate.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3477084.3484952", "Authors": ["Sahaya Beni Prathiba", "Gunasekaran Raja", "Sudha Anbalagan", "Renuka Narayanan", "K.

{"title": "Regulating Storage Overhead in Existing PoW-based Blockchains", "date": "11 June 2021", "abstract": "Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains regulate the frequency and security of extensions to the blockchain in a decentralized manner by adjusting the difficulty in the network. However, analogous decentralized measures to regulate the replication level of the associated transactions and blocks data are completely missing so far. We argue that such measures are required as well. On the one hand, the smaller the number of replicas, the higher the vulnerability of the system against compromises and DoS-attacks. On the other hand, the larger the number of replicas, the higher the storage overhead, and the higher the operational blockchain cost are. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, EWoK (Entangled proofs of WOrk and Knowledge), that regulates in a decentralized manner the minimum number of replicas that should be stored by miners in the blockchain. EWoK achieves this by tying replication to the only directly-incentivized process in PoW-blockchains -- which is PoW itself. EWoK only incurs small modifications to existing PoW protocols and is fully compliant with the specifications of existing mining hardware. Our implementation results confirm that EWoK can be easily integrated within existing mining pool protocols, such as GetBlockTemplate and Stratum mining, and does not impair the mining efficiency.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3450569.3463564", "Authors": ["Frederik Armknecht", "Jens-Matthias Bohli", "Ghassan O.

The benefits are further amplified when IIoT is integrated with cloud for collaboration and data analytic capability. Modern IIoT systems are highly dynamic and usually owned by multiple parties that need to collaborate with each other. These features make it harder to manage the system, and previous protection mechanisms such as physical separation and network isolation are not applicable any more. To mitigate the security risks without sacrificing the benefits of IIoT, we propose DL-DP, the decentralized ledger defined perimeter for IIoT. DL-DP introduces the concept of perimeter for IIoT resources management and isolation, and utilizes a novel hierarchy structure of decentralized ledger to effectively support a large number of IIoT devices and related cloud services. DL-DP provides a rich set of security functions including access control, denial-of-service mitigation and auditability.

To summarize and organize the insights of research in information systems (IS) on how BCT relates to transparency and, ultimately, sustainability of supply chains, this paper conducts a structured literature review. In total 46 articles have been identified and analyzed. The analysis shows that the potential of BCT to facilitate transparency in supply chains and thus enable sustainability measures stems from its decentralized and distributed nature. Further, BCT does not unfold this potential on its own; rather it is a technology that complements existing IS used to manage inter-organizational transactions. Overall, the paper contributes to the literature by providing a deeper insight into the possibilities, features, and merits of BCT in the SCM context, mainly focusing on transparency and sustainability matters. Summarizing and organizing the advantages of BCT and the shortcomings of existing IS used in SCM as discussed in prior research, this paper emphasizes that BCT needs to be considered as a complementary technology.

For this reason, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm, which already has advantages of energy efficiency and throughput, is attracting attention as an alternative to the PoW algorithm. With a PoS, the attacker needs to obtain 51% of the cryptocurrency to carry out a 51% attack. But unlike PoW, the attacker in a PoS system is highly discouraged from launching a 51% attack because he would have to risk losing his entire stake amount to do so. Moreover, even if a 51% attack succeeds, the value of PoS-based cryptocurrency will fall, and the attacker with the most stake will eventually lose the most. In this paper, we propose a predatory, destructive attack on PoS cryptocurrencies. The attacker destroys the PoS cryptocurrency system. Then, using the significant depreciation of cryptocurrency, our method can make a profit from a 51% attack on the PoS cryptocurrencies using the traditional stock market's ", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3410699.3413791", "Authors": ["Suhyeon Lee", "Seungjoo Kim"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450380799", "nombredePage": "81  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Korea University", "Korea University"], "Conference": "CryBlock '20: Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains for Distributed Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3410699", "Total_Citations": "1"},

While the security of these services is often well-researched, security implications of their required bootstrapping processes are usually neglected: Users either jointly conduct the anonymization themselves, or they need to rely on a set of non-colluding privacy peers. However, the typically small number of privacy peers enable single adversaries to mimic distributed services. We thus present AnonBoot, a Sybil-resistant medium to securely bootstrap distributed anonymity services via public blockchains. AnonBoot enforces that peers periodically create a small proof of work to refresh their eligibility for providing secure anonymity services. A pseudo-random, locally replicable bootstrapping process using on-chain entropy then prevents biasing the election of eligible peers.

{"title": "RapidChain: Scaling Blockchain via Full Sharding", "date": "15 October 2018", "abstract": "A major approach to overcoming the performance and scalability limitations of current blockchain protocols is to use sharding which is to split the overheads of processing transactions among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. These groups work in parallel to maximize performance while requiring significantly smaller communication, computation, and storage per node, allowing the system to scale to large networks. However, existing sharding-based blockchain protocols still require a linear amount of communication (in the number of participants) per transaction, and hence, attain only partially the potential benefits of sharding. We show that this introduces a major bottleneck to the throughput and latency of these protocols. Aside from the limited scalability, these protocols achieve weak security guarantees due to either a small fault resiliency (e.g., 1/8 and 1/4) or high failure probability, or they rely on strong assumptions (e.g., trusted setup) that limit their applicability to mainstream payment systems. We propose RapidChain, the first sharding-based public blockchain protocol that is resilient to Byzantine faults from up to a 1/3 fraction of its participants, and achieves complete sharding of the communication, computation, and storage overhead of processing transactions without assuming any trusted setup. RapidChain employs an optimal intra-committee consensus algorithm that can achieve very high throughputs via block pipelining, a novel gossiping protocol for large blocks, and a provably-secure reconfiguration mechanism to ensure robustness. Using an efficient cross-shard transaction verification technique, our protocol avoids gossiping transactions to the entire network. Our empirical evaluations suggest that RapidChain can process (and confirm) more than 7,300 tx/sec with an expected confirmation latency of roughly 8.7 seconds in a network of 4,000 nodes with an overwhelming time-to-failure of more than 4,500 years.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243853", "Authors": ["Mahdi Zamani", "Mahnush Movahedi", "Mariana Raykova"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450356930", "nombredePage": "2359  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "Dfinity, Palo Alto, CA, USA", "Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"], "Conference": "CCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3243734", "Total_Citations": "303"},

Unlike permissionless settings, e.g., Bitcoin, where the network is public, and anyone can participate without a specific identity, a permissioned blockchain system consists of a set of known, identified nodes that might not fully trust each other. While the characteristics of permissioned blockchains are appealing to a wide range of largescale data management systems, these systems, have to satisfy four main requirements: confidentiality, verifiability, performance, and scalability. Various approaches have been developed in industry and academia to satisfy these requirements with varying assumptions and costs. The focus of this tutorial is on presenting many of these techniques while highlighting the trade-offs among them. We demonstrate the practicality of such techniques in real-life by presenting three different applications, i.e., supply chain management, large-scale databases, and multi-platform crowdworking environments, and show how those techniques can be utilized to meet the requirements of such applications.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3457539", "Authors": ["Mohammad Javad Amiri", "Divyakant Agrawal", "Amr El Abbadi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["tutorial"], "ISBN": "9781450383431", "nombredePage": "2969  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA", "University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA", "University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3448016", "Total_Citations": "1"},

However, the federal-learning security mechanism remains not perfect. Using malicious training samples is considered to be vulnerable to attacks against machine learning models. Lastly, the substitution technique of the model is adopted to eliminate the learning effect of the final model. Though numerous security protocols have been formulated to defend against and prevent malicious attacks, most are active defenses against malicious attacks, instead of passive ones (e.g., distillation-based defense and regularization-based adversarial training). In the present study, a block chain-based passive defense model is proposed to protect the model. To be specific, when a participant updates its local model, model participation, user fingerprints and other key information will be stored on the chain. Malicious attacks can be therefore traced and detected. To ensure data integrity and confidentiality, model data is encrypted and updated via the blockchain.

Current issues with real estate are the lack of asset information availability, and once data is retrieved, its veracity. Moreover, data can be out of data or artificially manipulated for an economic benefit. An example could be the fire alarm inspection logs. On the other hand, the main benefits of tokenisation are 1) decentralisation from a single source of authority, 2) encryption of data that avoids tampering, and 3) digital proof of ownership. The NFT registers real estate static and dynamic information to be traded in the data marketplace between the different users and stakeholders such as investors, occupiers, insurers and property managers. The information registered in the NFT contains real estate deeds, transactions and relevant parameters that change over time. The infrastructure of the proposed real estate NFT consists of a private token in a private blockchain entirely developed for this application rather than ERC-1155 or ERC-721; therefore, a new crypto token is created. Furthermore, the consensus protocol is a mixture between the proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms by choosing random validators with staked Cryptocurrency already, such as Ethereum. Experimental results show that the increment of the NFT at every transaction does not produce an equal increment of mining time or mining nonce, making the NFT predictable for higher complex models.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3532640.3532651", "Authors": ["Will Serrano"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450395762", "nombredePage": "177  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University College London, UK"], "Conference": "ICBCT'22: The 2022 4th International Conference on Blockchain Technology", "doi": "10.1145/3532640", "Total_Citations": "0"},

However, resources and services are coupled on the Web. That's to say, users have to expose their data to service providers in order to trade for Web services. Consequently, users lose control to their personal data, and undertake the hazard of data abuse and privacy leakage. Distributed resource sharing systems are dedicated to solving this problem, which typically face huge challenges in terms of access control mechanisms and data availability. Blockchain-based methods provide an effective solution, but mining consumes large computing power overhead and the accomplishment of access control mechanism is incomplete. In view of the above-mentioned challenges encountered in distributed resource sharing systems, we design a secure resource sharing architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric, and established a dedicated network and consensus mechanism to avoid unnecessary energy costs. We developed a fine-grained access control implementation plan for both acquisition and modification operations to flexibly realize the users\u2019 unconditional control over personal data.

In this study, the researchers propose a multilateral personal portfolio authentication system that guarantees the reliability, integrity, and transparency of the data such as learner's schooling history. The system uses the features of blockchain in a distributed network wherein a learner submits schooling data to a peer in the network. The data is then verified through an agreement among the peers and recorded in a chronologically encrypted ledger. The proposed system is implemented based on Hyperledger Fabric and the analysis thereof conducted by evaluating its processing speed, capacity, and security. The analysis indicates that the system is able to successfully intercept the transactions of unvalidated users, thereby preventing the recording of incorrect data by an unauthorized user. Furthermore, it provides a record of previously made changes to a learner's profile, thus improving the integrity and reliability of the data.

Shard Scheduler reduces the number of costly cross-shard transactions, ensures balanced load distribution and maximizes the number of processed transactions for the blockchain as a whole. To this end, it leverages a novel incentive model motivating miners to maximize the global throughput of the entire blockchain rather than the throughput of a specific shard. In our simulations, Shard Scheduler can reduce the number of costly cross-shard transactions by half while ensuring equal load and increasing throughput more than 2 fold when using 60 shards. We also implement and evaluate Shard Scheduler on Chainspace, more than doubling its throughput and reducing user-perceived latency by 70% when using 10 shards.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3479722.3480989", "Authors": ["Micha\u0142 Kr\u00f3l", "Onur Ascigil", "Sergi Rene", "Alberto Sonnino", "Mustafa Al-Bassam", "Etienne Rivi\u00e8re"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450390828", "nombredePage": "225  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["City, University of London", "Lancaster University", "University College London", "Facebook Novi", "Celestia Labs", "UCLouvain"], "Conference": "AFT '21: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Conference on Advances in Financial Technologies", "doi": "10.1145/3479722", "Total_Citations": "1"},

{"title": "Bringing transparency and trust to elections: using blockchains for the transmission and tabulation of results", "date": "03 April 2019", "abstract": "The transmission and tabulation of results are critical steps in the election process. If election results are provided quickly and transparently, they may inspire trust and confidence in the overall management of the contest. On the contrary, the late and questionable delivery of results might raise concerns and suspicion. In some cases, improper counting and tabulation procedures have brought candidates to question election results and even spurred long periods of violence. In this paper, we explore the potential of blockchain technology to enhance the counting and tabulation procedures during elections. Blockchains are distributed ledgers technologies whose transactions are protected cryptographically. It means that their contents cannot be tampered with nor modified in the long term. We argue that blockchain technology meets the requirements for electronic transmission and consolidation of election results. To prove so, we have implemented a proof of concept with a smart contract running on an Ethereum blockchain that registers the address of several polling stations and records the tally sheets that these submit at the end of the election. We also resort to the smart contract for the automatic and accurate consolidation of the election results once they have been submitted.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3326365.3326372", "Authors": ["Adri\u00e0 Rodr\u00edguez-P\u00e9rez", "Pol Valletb\u00f3-Montfort", "Jordi Cucurull"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450366441", "nombredePage": "538  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Scytl Secure Electronic Voting, S.A., Barcelona, Spain", "Scytl Secure Electronic Voting, S.A., Barcelona, Spain", "Scytl Secure Electronic Voting, S.A., Barcelona, Spain"], "Conference": "ICEGOV2019: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance", "doi": "10.1145/3326365", "Total_Citations": "1"},
{"title": "Tuxedo: Maximizing Smart Contract Computation in PoW Blockchains", "date": "15 December 2021", "abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time (I) between blocks for validating smart contracts present in transactions. In such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time (\u03c4) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large \u03c4 also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale \u03c4/I \u22481 in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in parallel to ASIC mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to \u03b6 blocks, where \u03b6 is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay \u0394 and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale \u03c4 without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling up of \u03c4/I in existing blockchains", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3491053", "Authors": ["Sourav Das", "Nitin Awathare", "Ling Ren", "Vinay J.

Prior to our work, PoS protocols either required parties to obtain a trusted \"checkpoint\" block upon joining and, furthermore, to be frequently online or required an accurate estimate of the number of online parties to be hardcoded into the protocol logic. This ability of new parties to \"bootstrap from genesis\" was a hallmark property of the Bitcoin blockchain and was considered an important advantage of PoW-based blockchains over PoS-based blockchains since it facilitates robust operation in a setting with dynamic availability, i.e., the natural setting---without external trusted objects such as checkpoint blocks---where parties come and go arbitrarily, may join at any moment, or remain offline for prolonged periods of time. We prove the security of Ouroboros Genesis against a fully adaptive adversary controlling less than half of the total stake in a partially synchronous network with unknown message delay and unknown, varying levels of party availability. Our security proof is in the Universally Composable setting assuming the most natural abstraction of a hash function, known as the strict Global Random Oracle (ACM-CCS 2014); this highlights an important advantage of PoS blockchains over their PoW counterparts in terms of composability with respect to the hash function formalisation: rather than a strict GRO, PoW-based protocol security requires a \"local\" random oracle. Finally, proving the security of our construction against an adaptive adversary requires a novel martingale technique that may be of independent interest in the analysis of blockchain protocols.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243848", "Authors": ["Christian Badertscher", "Peter Ga\u017ei", "Aggelos Kiayias", "Alexander Russell", "Vassilis Zikas"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450356930", "nombredePage": "2359  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "IOHK, Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland Uk", "University of Connecticut, Storrs, USA", "University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland Uk"], "Conference": "CCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3243734", "Total_Citations": "105"},

The results show that there is a strong short-term volatility spillover effect in the two markets. However, Bitcoin trading volatility process weakens the short-term volatility spillover effect from Bitcoin market to banking industry in the United States and the volatility of banking industry returns (i.e. volatility of operational results) weakens the short-term volatility spillover effect from banking industry to Bitcoin market mainly due to inability of adoption in the short-run. Moreover, there is a significant and (positive) long-term volatility spillover effect from Bitcoin market to banking industry. This remarkable observation reveals that there is a possibility of banking industry adopting Bitcoin operation as a part of banking product portfolio development in the long-run. As such, imposition of any tax or trading restriction (e.g. price bands, transaction cost, tax etc.) on Bitcoin market will adversely impact the performance of banking industry in the long-run.

{"title": "Secure and Effective Implementation of an IOTA Light Node using STM32", "date": "10 November 2019", "abstract": "A major challenge in networked sensor systems and other IoT environments is addressing security. Vulnerabilities in those systems arise from poor physical security, unauthenticated devices, insecure firmware updates, insecure communication, and data corruption. In recent times Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), of which Blockchain is an instance, have been identified as a possible solution to some of these issues. The blokchain model genetically ensures decentralized security and privacy, and therefore could provide IoT systems with a trusted infrastructure for securely logging data or exchanging tokens without the necessity, and costs, of central servers. Blockchain is no panacea, either. IoT devices that get connected to a blockchain network must still be secured, in particular they must protect the confidentiality of the keys. This requires the embedded microcontroller to execute only authenticated firmware, with protections against software attacks, such as buffer overflows, and resistance against side-channel attacks. In addition, as confirmed from the scarcity of implementations reported in the literature, it is still not clear whether blockchain protocols can be implemented efficiently on resource-constrained IoT devices. In this work, also supported by a Demo, we show an example of secure IoT device that enables the functionalities of IOTA, a DLT specifically designed for the use in the IoT. In particular, we present a Light Node based on STM32 that implements all the cryptographic functions, IOTA specific operations and communication functions required to successfully publish transactions in the IOTA distributed ledger. Our implementations on microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M) performs up to 22 times faster in terms of cycles and up to 4 times faster in absolute time with respect to the state-of-the-art implementation on a Raspberry PI 3B. Our Light Node also ensures protection of the stored private data and guarantees secure firmware update thanks to a suitable configuration of some security features provided by STM32 microcontrollers.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3362744.3363344", "Authors": ["Diego Stucchi", "Ruggero Susella", "Pasqualina Fragneto", "Beatrice Rossi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["poster", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450370127", "nombredePage": "35  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["STMicroelectronics, System Research and Applications, Agrate Brianza, Italy", "STMicroelectronics, System Research and Applications, Agrate Brianza, Italy", "STMicroelectronics, System Research and Applications, Agrate Brianza, Italy", "STMicroelectronics, System Research and Applications, Agrate Brianza, Italy"], "Conference": "BlockSys'19: Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Blockchain-enabled Networked Sensor", "doi": "10.1145/3362744", "Total_Citations": "5"},

{"title": "Measuring the Binary Interestingness of Images: A Unified Prediction Framework Combining Discriminant Correlation Analysis and Multiple Kernel Learning", "date": "25 February 2022", "abstract": "In the modern content-based image retrieval systems, there is an increasingly interest in constructing a computationally effective model to measure the interestingness of images since the measurement of image interestingness could, more or less, improve the human-centered search satisfaction and the user experience in different applications. Typically, a couple of interestingness attributes (also called cues) are empirically selected and the corresponding features to capture these cues are elaborately leveraged in order to comprehensively represent the interestingness content underlying the images to be considered. How to make good use of these cues as well as the related features to arrive at an effective model to measure the interestingness of images is the core issue to be addressed in the big data era. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to predict the binary interestingness of images combining the discriminant correlation analysis (DCA)-based discriminative data fusion method and the multiple kernel learning (MKL)-based classification technique. More specially, on one hand, to reduce feature redundancy in describing the interestingness cues of images, the DCA or its multi-set variant is adopted to fuse multiple feature sets of the same type for individual cues by taking into account the class structure among the samples involved to describe three representative interestingness cues, i.e., unusualness, aesthetics and general preferences, with three sets of compact and discriminative features; on the other hand, to make good use of the heterogeneity from the three sets of high-level features for describing the interestingness cues, the SimpleMKL method is employed to enhance the generalization ability of the built model for binary interestingness measurement. Experimental results on the publicly-released interestingness evaluation data set have demonstrated the rationality and efficacy of the proposed framework where we conducted several groups of comparative studies across different interestingness feature combinations, different interestingness cues, as well as different feature types for the three interestingness cues.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3510487.3510512", "Authors": ["Qiang Sun", "Liting Wang", "Maohui Li", "Longtao Zhang", "Jiaxiao Li", "Shiqian Wang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387460", "nombredePage": "183  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, China", "School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, China", "School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, China", "School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, China", "School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, China", "Beijing BOE Display Technology Co.,Ltd., China"], "Conference": "ICBTA 2021: 2021 4th International Conference on Blockchain Technology and Applications", "doi": "10.1145/3510487", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "The Composable Finance Mosaic Bridge and Liquidity Forecasting", "date": "18 April 2022", "abstract": "We introduce the forecasting technology behind Composable Finance's (Composable's)1 cross-layer cross-chain bridge Mosaic2 . Mosaic contains a network of vaults, one on each layer and chain, and we present our research into improving the operation and robustness of said bridge via liquidity forecasting of its associated vaults. Users utilize the bridge to transfer assets from a source network and source layer (a source vault) to a destination network and layer (a destination vault). However, if a vault is near depletion when a transfer is initiated the transfer can fail due to inefficient liquidity. Thus, critical to maximizing the user experience of Mosaic is being able to forecast accurately when the liquidity will be depleted from vaults supported by Mosaic. After introducing Mosaic, and without loss of generality, we forecast liquidity movements between three vaults: one on the layer 1 (L1) Ethereum mainnet, one on the L2 Polygon (POL) network, and one on the L2 Arbitrum (ARB) network. We demonstrate state of the art results from our statistical and AI methods that can consistently achieve low average errors (e.g., <2% liquidity) and high coverage (e.g., >80%) of the true liquidity levels in their 1-week-ahead forecast confidence intervals. As a baseline, we first develop autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting. The ARIMA models are optimized at each time step and provide conservative confidence intervals that allow us to safely assess the times when vaults will reach critical liquidity values and therefore, prevent depletion. To further enhance our forecasting framework, we also develop a machine learning approach with Gaussian Processes that can further capture time series trends, past replenishment events, where large discontinuities are present. Liquidity data for our forecasting methodologies will be provided in two levels of fidelity. We first introduce our in-house Liquidity Simulation Environment (LSE) - a state machine capable of running hypothetical vault liquidity scenarios under certain assumed cross-layer trades/swaps. Next, we forecast real-world data obtained from a recent PoC three-vault bridge setup run by Composable, and we apply the LSE to that. Finally, we provide our thoughts on forecasting beyond the PoC - our work will be of interest to layer 1, layer 2, cross-layer cross-chain, and AI researchers working on DeFi and blockchain technologies.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3523181.3523198", "Authors": ["Panos", "0xzoro", "Jesper Kristensen", "0xbrainjar"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387453", "nombredePage": "202  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Advanced Blockchain Research, Cyprus", "Advanced Blockchain Research, Cyprus", "Advanced Blockchain Research, Cyprus", "Composable Finance Labs, Cyprus"], "Conference": "ASSE' 22: 2022 3rd Asia Service Sciences and Software Engineering Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3523181", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Network embedding is a method of analyzing a network to learn the low-dimensional potential representation of vertices in a continuous vector space, and the representation results will be easily applied to various statistical models and machine learning algorithms. Previous studies have focused on preserving the structural information of vertices at specific scales.

The federated node is embedded with the community.

Using the cyclic stationarity of the communication signal with the symbol interval as the cycle, the method firstly performs a short-time Fourier transform with a window period, and converts the received time domain signal into time-frequency image; Secondly, the time-frequency image as a shallow feature is sent to the VGG-16 convolutional neural network model for training, and the features of the OFDM signal and several single-carrier communication signals are automatically extracted in the two dimensions of time and frequency; Then, the Softmax function is selected in the output layer of the network to map the output of the neuron to the probability space to calculate the probability of the category of the signal, and completes the modulation classification of the OFDM signal and other signals. Finally, the modulation recognition process of OFDM signal and several single carrier signals with equal symbol interval are simulated, and the results show that the proposed method can realize the modulation recognition of OFDM signal.

Fortunately, blockchain technique can provide a decentralized and secure IoT framework to deal with security issues based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, openness, transparency and traceability. However, the blockchain consensus protocol guarantees the safety and reliability of data, but it also brings problems such as scalability limitations and poor storage extensibility, resulting in the inability to directly integrate blockchain and the IoT in existing conditions. In this paper, a private three-tier local blockchain, Three-tier architecture Blockchain (TBchain), is proposed to solve the problem by splitting part of the transactions in the public blockchain and locking them in a higher-level blockchain TBchain. Additionally, the private blockchain TBchain is connected to the public blockchain to build a hierarchical blockchain network to provide privacy protection for the IoT data stored on the blockchain. Finally, we implement an IoT framework based on TBchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to realize the decentralized IoT, which guarantees the user\u2019s access control right to personal data. Experimental results show that the IoT framework based on TBchain and IPFS realizes the user\u2019s access control right to personal data by verifying in advance to ensure the confidentiality and security of shared data, and improves the security and privacy of IoT data and transactions.

{"title": "MUSCLE: authenticated external data retrieval from multiple sources for smart contracts", "date": "08 April 2019", "abstract": "Smart contracts are applications that are deployed and executed on a blockchain's decentralised infrastructure. Many smart contract applications rely on data that resides outside the blockchain. However, while traditional web applications can communicate with trustworthy data sources directly through the Internet, this is not possible for smart contracts because their execution must be deterministic. Bringing external data into the blockchain has been a topic of research since the first introduction of Ethereum. A system that can provide this data to smart contracts is called an oracle. The primary requirement in designing oracles is that the authenticity of the data must be publicly verifiable, which can be achieved through signatures. However, transmitting data to the blockchain and performing the verification is costly, especially if applications require data from multiple sources. In that case, current approaches would need to retrieve the data from each source separately. In this paper, we present the concept of MUlti-Source oraCLE (MUSCLE) for retrieving data from multiple sources, which we believe to be the first to focus on the multi-source scenario. We implement five variants of MUSCLE, each using a different signature or aggregate signature scheme and compare their performance with two oracles that are based on TLS-N, which represents the current state of the art. Our results show that the ECDSA-based MUSCLE features the lowest total gas expenditure, while the BGLS-based oracle provides lower transaction and storage costs.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297320", "Authors": ["Bjorn van der Laan", "O\u011fuzhan Ersoy", "Zekeriya Erkin"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450359337", "nombredePage": "2682  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands", "Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands", "Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"], "Conference": "SAC '19: Proceedings of the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3297280", "Total_Citations": "2"},

The e-Voting system is implemented with three main components: private blockchain network, smart contract, and web service as an interface to manager and voters. The functional evaluation on the data store, display, update, delete, verify voters, authenticate voters, and the integrity of the election process in the private blockchain network are all well-functioning, even without an overvote. The nonfunctional evaluation shows that the system can guarantee the data integrity of the election result, the confidentiality of voter identity with its selection, the auditability of transactions, and the maximum scale of load that system can handle.

{"title": "\u00d0Archer: detecting on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in decentralized applications", "date": "18 August 2021", "abstract": "Since the emergence of Ethereum, blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps) have become increasingly popular and important. To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework, \u00d0Archer, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have evaluated \u00d0Archer on 11 popular real-world DApps. \u00d0Archer achieves high precision (99.3%), recall (87.6%), and accuracy (89.4%) in bug detection and significantly outperforms the baseline methods.

{"title": "A Framework to Generate Smart Contracts On the Fly", "date": "05 October 2021", "abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology that offers a secure decentralized network, and allows for direct transactions between distributed entities, without the need for a trusted third party. Smart contracts are executable codes hosted on the blockchain and enable the implementation of several decentralized applications, in different domains. However, due to the complexity of contract construction, it is necessary to seek ways to facilitate and make this innovative development process robust. This paper presents Gifflar, a framework for generating smart contract code on the fly, in such a way that it allows a system to write, compile and implement blockchain contracts with a decentralized application still running. Gifflar is structured in components that implement design patterns to better define the responsibility of each one of the parts and exports a simple interaction module for contract modeling in JSON and automatic code writing using the TypeScript language. As far as we know, this framework is one of the first to generate contracts dynamically at run time. Thus, the work contributes to the state of the art by addressing a new paradigm, where systems can act as smart contract developers.

{"title": "NeuChain: a fast permissioned blockchain system with deterministic ordering", "date": "29 September 2022", "abstract": "Blockchain serves as a replicated transactional processing system in a trustless distributed environment. Existing blockchain systems all rely on an explicit ordering step to determine the global order of transactions that are collected from multiple peers. The ordering consensus can be the bottleneck since it must be Byzantine-fault tolerant and can scarcely benefit from parallel execution. In this paper, we propose an ordering-free architecture that makes ordering implicit through deterministic execution. Based on this novel architecture, we develop a permissioned blockchain system NeuChain. A number of key optimizations such as asynchronous block generation and pipelining are leveraged for high throughput and low latency. Several security mechanisms are also designed to make our system robust to malicious attacks. Our geo-distributed experimental results show that NeuChain can achieve 47.2--64.1X throughput improvement over HyperLedger Fabric and 1.6--12.2X throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art high performance blockchains.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.14778/3551793.3551816", "Authors": ["Zeshun Peng", "Yanfeng Zhang", "Qian Xu", "Haixu Liu", "Yuxiao Gao", "Xiaohua Li", "Ge Yu"], "Publisher": "VLDB Endowment", "publisherAddress": null, "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "2150-8097", "nombredePage": "980  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Northeastern University, China", "Northeastern University, China", "Northeastern University, China", "Northeastern University, China", "Northeastern University, China", "Northeastern University, China", "Northeastern University, China"], "Conference": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "doi": ",", "Total_Citations": "0"},

ECDSA is the most commonly used cryptographic scheme in permissioned blockchains. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of ECDSA signature verification on FPGA, in order to improve performance of permissioned blockchains that aim to use FPGA-based hardware accelerators. We propose several optimizations for modular arithmetic (e.g., custom multipliers and fast modular reduction) and point arithmetic (e.g., reduced number of point double and addition operations, and optimal width NAF representation). Based on these optimized modular and point arithmetic modules, we propose an ECDSA verification engine that can be used by any application for fast verification of signatures. We further optimize our ECDSA verification engine for Hyperledger Fabric (one of the most widely used blockchain platforms) by moving carefully selected operations to a precomputation block, thus simplifying the critical path of ECDSA signature verification. Our ECDSA engine running at 250MHz on Xilinx Alveo U250 accelerator card can perform a verification in 760 microseconds with a throughput of 1,315 verifications/second, which is ~2.5 times faster than state-of-the-art FPGA-based implementations.

Findings contribute to HCI theories by extending the exploration of blockchain's characteristics relevant to trust with the competitiveness dimension underpinning the social organization of mining.

{"title": "A Security Framework for Distributed Ledgers", "date": "13 November 2021", "abstract": "In the past few years blockchains have been a major focus for security research, resulting in significant progress in the design, formalization, and analysis of blockchain protocols. However, the more general class of distributed ledgers, which includes not just blockchains but also prominent non-blockchain protocols, such as Corda and OmniLedger, cannot be covered by the state-of-the-art in the security literature yet. These distributed ledgers often break with traditional blockchain paradigms, such as block structures to store data, system-wide consensus, or global consistency. In this paper, we close this gap by proposing the first framework for defining and analyzing the security of general distributed ledgers, with an ideal distributed ledger functionality, called Fledger, at the core of our contribution. This functionality covers not only classical blockchains but also non-blockchain distributed ledgers in a unified way. To illustrate Fledger, we first show that the prominent ideal block-chain functionalities Gledger and GPL realize (suitable instantiations of) Fledger, which captures their security properties. This implies that their respective implementations, including Bitcoin, Ouroboros Genesis, and Ouroboros Crypsinous, realize Fledger as well. Secondly, we demonstrate that Fledger is capable of precisely modeling also non-blockchain distributed ledgers by performing the first formal security analysis of such a distributed ledger, namely the prominent Corda protocol. Due to the wide spread use of Corda in industry, in particular the financial sector, this analysis is of independent interest. These results also illustrate that Fledger not just generalizes the modular treatment of blockchains to distributed ledgers, but moreover helps to unify existing results.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3485362", "Authors": ["Mike Graf", "Daniel Rausch", "Viktoria Ronge", "Christoph Egger", "Ralf K\u00fcsters", "Dominique Schr\u00f6der"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450384544", "nombredePage": "3558  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany", "University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany", "Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany", "Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany", "University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany", "Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"], "Conference": "CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3460120", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Earlier, it has been at the cost of individual\u2019s privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant\u2019s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the concept of in-place model training by keeping the data intact to the device. Though it is privacy-preserving in nature, however, it is susceptible to inference, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. Blockchain is a decentralized programming paradigm that provides a broader control of the system, making it attack resistant. It poses challenges of high computing power, storage, and latency. These emerging technologies can contribute to the desired learning system and motivate them to address their security and efficiency issues. This article systematizes the security issues in Federated Learning, its corresponding mitigation strategies, and Blockchain\u2019s challenges.

{"title": "Smart Contract Languages: A Multivocal Mapping Study", "date": "02 January 2021", "abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has attracted the attention of the scientific community and companies, as proven by the exponential growth of publications on this topic in recent years. This growing interest is mainly due to the promise that the use of blockchain enables it to be verified, without including any trusted intermediaries, that the information received from the network is authentic and up-to-date. In this respect, blockchain is a distributed database that can be seen as a ledger that records all transactions that have ever been executed. In this context, smart contracts are pieces of software used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a transaction on a blockchain platform. These pieces of software are implemented by using programming languages, which are sometimes provided by the blockchain platforms themselves. This study aims to (1) identify and categorise the state-of-the-art related to smart contract languages, in terms of the existing languages and their main features, and (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a multivocal mapping study that follows the guidelines proposed by Garousi et\u00a0al. for conducting multivocal literature reviews, as well as the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for conducting mapping studies. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 4,119 papers were gathered, and 109 of them were selected for extraction. The contributions of this article are twofold: (1) 101 different smart contract languages have been identified and classified according to a variety of criteria; (2) a discussion on the findings and their implications for future research have been outlined. As a conclusion, it could be stated that a rigorous and replicable overview of the state-of-the-art of smart contract languages has been provided that can benefit not only researchers but also practitioners in the field, thanks to its multivocal nature.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3423166", "Authors": ["\u00c1ngel Jes\u00fas Varela-Vaca", "Antonia M.

{"title": "LedgerView: Access-Control Views on Hyperledger Fabric", "date": "11 June 2022", "abstract": "We present LedgerView -- a system that adds access control views to permissioned blockchains. The approach is motivated by an AT&T application of tracking refurbished devices. A blockchain is a decentralized tamper-resistant ledger managed by a group of peers. It is used in many applications for storing and sharing sensitive information, e.g., monetary transactions, health records, personal documents, etc. But in blockchain, all the peers see all the stored transactions, while in some applications, access to sensitive information should be limited, that is, concealed from peers and users who do not have proper access permissions. In database management systems, sets of records that are visible to some users and concealed from others are defined by views, but existing blockchain systems lack such access-control capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we introduce access-control views for Hyperledger Fabric. We present two types of views -- irrevocable and revocable, according to whether access to sensitive information can or cannot be revoked. We explain how to implement the two types of view by using cryptographic hash functions and encryption keys, and we show how to support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Experiments with supply chain transactions illustrate the incurred costs of the views in LedgerView, including latency, transaction rate and storage overhead.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3514221.3526046", "Authors": ["Pingcheng Ruan", "Yaron Kanza", "Beng Chin Ooi", "Divesh Srivastava"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450392495", "nombredePage": "2597  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore", "AT&T Chief Data Office, Bedminster, NJ, USA", "National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore", "AT&T Chief Data Office, Bedminster, NJ, USA"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '22: Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3514221", "Total_Citations": "0"},

These protocols are critical systems as they handle assets. Therefore, it must be sure that the system does not contain errors. In this paper, we describe the Cross-Chain Swap problem in a formal way. We define safety and weak-liveness properties that guarantee no correct participant will be worse-off in an asynchronous system. Moreover, we provide a formally proved Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that satisfies the swap specification.

{"title": "Efficient Deterministic Concurrency Control Under Practical Isolation Levels", "date": "18 June 2021", "abstract": "Deterministic databases are able to run transactions efficiently in a distributed setting with minimal coordination. Research has shown many benefits from having determinism, from more lightweight database replication, to no/cheaper distributed commit, to high throughput during live migration. Besides those known applications, permissioned blockchain can also be viewed as an application of the deterministic database with security added. A permissioned blockchain maintains a fully-replicated database, where each replica is synchronized by getting blocks of updates. Early permissioned blockchains run a consensus protocol (e.g., PBFT) to agree on the input and rely on the replicas to execute the transactions serially to uphold determinism. Fabric allows concurrent transaction executions but rely on running consensus to agree on the read-write-sets and broadcasting them, which incurs an excessive volume of network traffic. Deterministic concurrency control combines the best of both worlds. It enables solving consensus on the small input, and each replica is able to execute transactions independently with high concurrency. Although powerful, contemporary deterministic databases are still primitive because they support only one isolation level -- Serializable. Furthermore, many deterministic concurrency control schemes are overly pessimistic and cause many unnecessary transaction aborts. These factors motivate us to design DCC, a suite of better deterministic concurrency control schemes, not only for Serializable but also for practical isolation levels beyond Serializable.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3450580", "Authors": ["Ziliang Lai"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["abstract"], "ISBN": "9781450383431", "nombredePage": "2969  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"], "Conference": "SIGMOD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data", "doi": "10.1145/3448016", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "Preserving Privacy using Distributed Ledger Technology in Intelligent Transportation System", "date": "24 October 2022", "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is an enhanced application which mainly aims towards the curation of smart and interconnectivity services to ease the existing transportation systems. It is a field with a plethora of future possibilities so as to provide efficient and advanced techniques by solving and tackling the existing challenges and problems. Especially in cities and countries which aim towards developing smart cities, ITS plays an essential role in advancing the transportation sector with regards to the city. Using a number of AI and ML techniques, a variety of approaches, algorithms and techniques can be put to effective utilization to boost the ITS ecosystem. However, with every boon compliment few banes and plausible bottlenecks. One of the major concerns while using V2V networks is the privacy and security issue. The data being transferred amidst vehicles mainly caters to the status updates on the vehicles adjacent to it, the speed, and driver's information in case of any accidents or wherever required. In such cases, the privacy of the drivers details and personal information are at stake and often poses a major security challenge. Furthermore, there are chances of data breaches and similar attacks by malicious users which can lead to huge data loss and tampering of data. A possible solution to this problem is to approach it through the perspective of Blockchain. Blockchain is a concept of sharing information/ data in a distributed and decentralized manner. The numerous blocks present in a blockchain which are responsible for storing information do so by encrypting and securing the data and hence can be integrated with a V2V system for overcoming the privacy and security challenges.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3549206.3549306", "Authors": ["Amit Kumar Tyagi", "Meghna Manoj Nair"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450396752", "nombredePage": "710  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Centre for Advanced Data Science, Vellore Institute of Technology, India", "School of Computer Science Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, India"], "Conference": "IC3-2022: Proceedings of the 2022 Fourteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3549206", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "TheChain: A Fast, Secure and Parallel Treatment of Transactions", "date": "25 August 2020", "abstract": "The Smart Distributed Ledger (aka blockchain) has attracted much attention in recent years. According to the European Parliament, this technology has the potential to change the lives of many people. The blockchain is a data structure built upon a hashed function in a distributed network, enabled by an incentive mechanism to discourage malicious nodes from participation. The consensus is at the core of the blockchain technology, and is driven by information embedded into a data structure that takes many forms such as linear, tree, and graph chains. The found related information will be subject to various validation incentives among the miners, such as proof of stake and proof of work. However, all the existing solutions suffer from a heavy state transition before dealing with the problem of a validation mechanism which suffers from resource consumption, monopoly or attacks. This work raises the following question: \"Why is there a need for consensus where all participants can make a quick and correct decision?\", and underlines the fact that sometimes ledger is subject to maintenance from regional parties in the data that leads to partial territories and eliminates monopoly, which is the hurdle to eliminating the trusted party. The validity of the blockchain transaction comes from the related information scattered above the data structure, and the authenticity lies in the digital signature. The aim is to switch from a validator based on incentives to a broadcaster governed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm, and the integrity does lie in the intersection among regions. However, the data structure takes advantage of the Petri network regarding its suitability. Building the entire ledger in the Petri network model will allow parallel processing of the transactions and securing of the total order between the participants on the memory reference layer. Moreover, it takes account of validation criteria quickly and safely before adding the new transaction list using the graph reachability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3409934.3409944", "Authors": ["Mohamed Ikbal Nacer", "Simant Prakoonwit", "Ismail Alarab"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377706", "nombredePage": "184  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Bournemouth University, Bournemouth, UK", "Bournemouth University, Bournemouth, UK", "Bournemouth University, Bournemouth, UK"], "Conference": "IECC '20: Proceedings of the 2nd International Electronics Communication Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3409934", "Total_Citations": "2"},

However, determining what the allowed behavior of an IoT device should be remains an open challenge. Proposals to date have relied on manufacturers and trusted parties to provide allow lists of network traffic, but these proposals require manufacturer involvement or placing trust in an additional stakeholder. Alternatively, locally monitoring devices can allow building allow lists of observed behavior, but devices may not exhaust their functionality set during the observation period, and the behavior may change following a software update which requires re-training. This paper proposes a blockchain-based system for determining whether an IoT device is behaving like other devices of the same type. Our system, SERENIoT, overcomes the challenge of initially determining the correct behavior for a device. Nodes in the SERENIoT public blockchain submit summaries of the network behavior observed for connected IoT devices and build allow lists of behavior observed by the majority of nodes. Changes in behavior through software updates are automatically added to the allow list once the update is broadly deployed. Through a proof-of-concept implementation of SERENIoT on a small IoT network and a large-scale Amazon EC2 simulation, we evaluate the security, scalability, and performance of our system.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3427228.3427235", "Authors": ["Corentin Thomasset", "David Barrera"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450388580", "nombredePage": "962  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Canada", "Carleton Univeristy, Canada"], "Conference": "ACSAC '20: Annual Computer Security Applications Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3427228", "Total_Citations": "1"},

{"title": "When the Recursive Diversity Anonymity Meets the Ring Signature", "date": "18 June 2021", "abstract": "In privacy-preserving blockchain systems, to protect a sender's identity of a transaction in privacy-preserving blockchain systems, ring signature (RS) schemes have been widely implemented, which allow users to obscure consumed tokens via including \"mixin'' (i.e., chaff tokens). However, recent works point out that existing RS schemes are vulnerable to the \"chain-reaction'' analysis, where adversaries eliminate mixins of RSs by utilizing the fact that each token can only be consumed in a RS. By \"chain-reaction'' analysis, adversaries can find some definite token-RS pair sets (DTRSs) to confirm the sender's identity of a RS. Besides, the existing RS schemes do not consider the diversity of mixins when generating a RS. Moreover, since the transaction fee is proportional to the number of mixins, a use is motivated to use a RS with the minimum number of mixins. In this paper, we formally define the diversity-aware mixins selection (DA-MS) problem, which aims to generate a RS with the minimum number of mixins satisfying the constraints of its diversity and the anonymity of other RSs. We prove the DA-MS problem is $\\#P$ and propose a breadth-first search algorithm to get the optimal solution. Furthermore, to efficiently solve the DA-MS problem, we propose two practical configurations and two approximation algorithms with theoretic guarantees.

In the original protocol, the distributor and user are both equipped with trusted hardware. The data are encrypted and decrypted by this trusted hardware, with a shared secret key. When decrypting the data, the user's hardware generates a proof and sends it to the distributor. This proof is used as the proof of distribution to show to the owner for payment. This prevents the collusion with the help of the trusted hardware. This protocol assumes that the user will not misbehave and always send the proof back to the distributor.

{"title": "The Quest for Fully Smart Autonomous Business Networks in IoT Platforms", "date": "12 December 2017", "abstract": "The evolution of the business networks is fostering the demand for more connected devices to execute tangled and sophisticated business operations. This leverages complicated business networks space to include scalable network layers, more devices, and platforms relying on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Despite the fact that traditional IoT platforms usually target the technical side for IoT applications, they are not prepared enough to be easily integrated with pluggable and executable business logic or smart contracts. This makes it difficult to control a collection of shared business network resources in a standard and decentralized manner. With the rise of FinTech due to blockchain technology, it becomes possible to seamlessly engage business networks with financial digital assets. Consequently, combining IoT platforms with blockchain will drive new ways for better services consuming, transparency and products that depend on crowd-based economy [12]. In this paper, Sitechain is proposed as a new architecture to integrate IoT platforms with blockchain technology. The proposed architecture is not locked to specific IoT platforms but it can be extended to support different platforms in a standard, systematic and easy way. Sitechain is demonstrated by integrating Sitewhere and FIWARE IoT platforms with Hyperledger Fabric as a private blockchain network manager. Moreover a modeling language supported by Hyperledger composer is used to easily develop smart contracts and generate RESTful APIs, therefore any smart contract transaction events can be mapped into actions on remote devices.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3178298.3178301", "Authors": ["Ahmed Abdullah Ali", "Iman A.

{"title": "Secure Drone Identification with Hyperledger Iroha", "date": "22 November 2021", "abstract": "Interet-of-Things (IoT) devices such as drones are becoming more prevalent, but still have blatant security issues. DRIP is a newly proposed protocol for drones that aims to enable users to securely identify drones and trust in messages sent by them. However, some implementation details, such as registries, are yet to be determined. The decentralization, auditability and persistency of blockchain makes it a great candidate to be used as a registry in DRIP. This paper analyzes how Hyperledger Iroha, a permission-based blockchain framework, can be used to fulfill the registry requirements in DRIP, and propose an architecture using it as a registry. Findings show that, thanks to its support for various permissions, multi-signature transactions, and smart contracts, it is able to not only fulfill the requirements, but also enhance other security details of the proposed architecture. Furthermore, this paper also evaluates the performance of Iroha, with results showing that its low consensus delay is adequate to be used for real-time location updates.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3479243.3487305", "Authors": ["Yousef Hashem", "Elmedin Zildzic", "Andrei Gurtov"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450390811", "nombredePage": "82  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden", "Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden", "Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"], "Conference": "DIVANet '21: Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Design and Analysis of Intelligent Vehicular Networks and Applications", "doi": "10.1145/3479243", "Total_Citations": "0"},

With the continuous development of data sharing, big data applications and other technologies, new requirements are proposed for the storage of medical privacy data. At present, medical data have the characteristics of obstructed sharing and exchange, difficult data tracing and data sensitivity, which increases the cost and difficulty of each diagnosis. Moreover, patients lack the right to know and control their own medical data, which is easy to cause data fraud or data leakage. As a decentralized, tamper proof and traceable distributed ledger system, blockchain brings new solutions to these problems.

It can not only solve the problem of mutual distrust in the traditional system, but also realize the safe data storage and the safe sharing of medical record data between medical organizations which is a beneficial attempt to overcome the disadvantages of traditional hospital data separation.

Most VoD services nowadays adopt a centralized-based architecture such that, service providers can have a total control over all system transactions (e.g., watched history, video royalty fee payment). The problem of a centralized-based architecture is the server-side bottleneck issue. The system maintenance cost for avoiding such an issue can be dramatically expensive. This maintenance cost can be reduced by adopting a decentralized-based architecture instead. However, the lack of a total control over user transactions in a decentralized-based architecture limits the capability of the service on being able to deploy commercially. In this study, we propose to apply Blockchain in a decentralized-based VoD service to overcome such a limitation. A new cryptocurrency so-called VoDCoin and its architecture design are proposed.

{"title": "Improving Streaming Cryptocurrency Transaction Classification via Biased Sampling and Graph Feedback", "date": "06 December 2021", "abstract": " We show that knowledge of wallet addresses from the current time state of a blockchain network, such as Bitcoin, increases the performance of illicit activity detection. Based on this finding we introduce two new methods for the sampling of classifier training data so that precedence is given to transaction information from the recent past and the current time state. This sampling enables streaming classification in which a decision on the class of a transaction needs to be made based on data seen to date. Our new approach provides insight into how the dynamics of the blockchain network plays a central role in the detection of illicit transactions, and is independent of the classifier choice. Our proposed sampling methods enable graph convolution network (GCN) and random forest (RF) classifiers to better adapt to changes in the network due to significant events, such as the closure of a large \u2018Darknet\u2019 marketplace.

The paradigm aims to decentralize the existing cloud infrastructure by incorporating resources co-located alongside its client. Researchers have also proposed solutions for a fully decentralized crowdsourced compute paradigm enabled by Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). This paper investigates the rationale behind DLTs over crowdsourced resource marketplaces to support the requirements of latency-critical applications targeted by edge computing. We develop a fully configurable NEtworked Blockchain emULAtor, or NEBULA, to scrutinize the internal performance bottlenecks of DLTs. We evaluate two blockchain categories - proof-based (popularly used in Bitcoin, Ethereum) and hybrid consensus and find that the enabling factor of DLTs -scale - is also its primary latency contributor. We show that, in reality, the latency overheads due to DLT operation far exceed the operational requirements of edge applications.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3488663.3493687", "Authors": ["Leo Eichhorn", "Tanya Shreedhar", "Aleksandr Zavodovski", "Nitinder Mohan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450391382", "nombredePage": "42  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Technical University of Munich, Germany", "IIIT Delhi India", "Uppsala University, Sweden", "Technical University of Munich, Germany"], "Conference": "IWCI'21: Proceedings of the Interdisciplinary Workshop on (de) Centralization in the Internet", "doi": "10.1145/3488663", "Total_Citations": "1"},

{"title": "Decentralized Finance (DEFI) as the Basis for the Transformation of the Financial Sector of the Future", "date": "28 September 2022", "abstract": "The paper discusses the influence exerted by financial systems on the change of the financial sector and its further development. The study is relevant since there is need for building up more trust in blockchain. In the course of the research, the main trends of decentralized financial systems were identified and presented, including the problems related to decentralized financial systems and options for resolving them. The study is aimed at defining the problems and searching for ways to tackle them when regulating decentralized finances (DeFi) in order to ensure effective regulation on the part of the Central Bank and control risks. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, DeFi, in fact, has to be regulated so as to achieve its main decentralization goal. In addition, DeFi presents a potential possibility for developing a fairly new regulation method: the idea of \u201cintegrated regulation\u201d. The paper considers various approaches to regulation, which can be integrated in the DeFi design. It can potentially lead to the decentralization of both finance and its regulation, which eventually expresses RegTech (Regulatory Technology), which is used by financial organizations for being able to meet the requirements of the regulator more easily. The study defines the problems that are encountered in the course of using DeFi and points out the possible ways for dealing with them, including a way for switching to blockchain independently so that the transaction is not charged in ETH for calculation on blockchain; reducing the complexity and costs of use and understanding of DeFi software by most users. A whole lot of risks that decentralized financial protocols are susceptible to is analyzed: vulnerabilities in the code security of smart contracts, their stacking and layout; oracle risk, which is subject to manipulation in the process of data transfer; the financial risk of high volatility, regulatory risk and crisis of the global economy due to the inability to predict in which way the Covid-19 pandemic is going to be resolved.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3527049.3527080", "Authors": ["Oleg Ryabov", "Artem Golubev", "Natalia Goncharova"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450386944", "nombredePage": "433  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["The North-West Institute of Management branch of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, Russia", "The North-West Institute of Management branch of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, Russia", "Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, Russia"], "Conference": "SPBPU IDE '21: Proceedings of the 3rd International Scientific Conference on Innovations in Digital Economy", "doi": "10.1145/3527049", "Total_Citations": "0"},

They often exploit Internet-of-Things technologies to support their monitoring functions, and blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of their data. Ethereum and business blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric, are popular choices for SC development. However, there is a gap in the knowledge of SCs between developers and legal experts. Symboleo is a formal specification language for legal contracts that was introduced to address this issue. Symboleo specifications directly encode legal concepts such as parties, obligations, and powers. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported method for translating Symboleo specifications into smart contracts. We have extended the current Symboleo IDE, implemented the ontology and semantics of Symboleo into a reusable library, and developed the Symboleo2SC tool to generate Hyperledger Fabric code exploiting this library. Symboleo2SC was evaluated with three sample contracts. The results shows that legal contract specifications in Symboleo can be fully converted to SCs for monitoring purposes.

A Secure Video Suite Platform for Online Care, Teleconsultation and Tele-orientation", "date": "22 June 2022", "abstract": " One of the major problems faced by public health managers around the globe is the lack of specialized professionals in remote locations to meet the health demands of society. To propose a solution for these problems, the authors developed the Video for Health (V4H) Platform for Brazil\u2019s National Education and Research Network (RNP), a Research and Development agency from the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI), which will be the topic of this proposed demo. The V4H is a system that aims to reduce the distance between health professionals and the population that needs primary care. The original proposal of the V4H was developed in two teams: Working group phase 1 (WG1) and Working Group phase 2 (WG2) at the Federal University of Para\u00edba (UFPB). The first working group grant went to develop the design of the system and it was tested at the Telehealth Center and the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Unifesp), at the S\u00e3o Paulo Area Military Hospital (HMASP) and at the TeleDentistry project at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s (USP) Dentistry School (FOUSP). In the second phase of the project we developed more complex systems such as blockchain for video preservation, billing, time control and accessibility for the teleconsultations. The platform was tested and integrated with University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Hearth Institute (InCOR). The WG2 was coordinated by Prof. Guido Lemos (UFPB) and Prof. Marco Antonio Gutierrez (InCOR). The V4H Platform supports synchronous and confidential video streaming, with a scalable architecture to simplify integration with telehealth, teleconsulting and Electronic Health Record (HRE) platforms. The V4H system allows the authentication of the participants of the transmission, as well as the recording, retrieval and preservation of the transmitted content, using signature technologies with digital certificates and blockchain to ensure that the content remains immutable and providing the integrity and authenticity of the persisted data. The main focus of the solution is to offer a synchronous video service for platforms that support the electronic health record, where the recorded and preserved contents can be attached together with the patient\u2019s data, serving as legal evidence of the healthcare provided. There is also the possibility that these contents can be used as a data source for teleconsulting, tele-diagnosis and preceptorship activities for health professionals from all areas, initially focusing on basic and primary health care, in locations that lack specialized health professionals.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3505284.3532815", "Authors": ["Guido Lemos de Souza Filho", "Cicero Inacio da Silva", "Denio Mariz Timoteo de Souza", "Giuliano Maia Lins de Castro", "Lucas Oliveira Costa Aversari", "Jose Leoberto Soares Filho", "Marcelo de Abreu Borges"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["demonstration", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450392129", "nombredePage": "390  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Federal University of Para\u00edba (UFPB), Brazil", "Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Unifesp), Brazil", "Para\u00edba Federal Institute of Technology (IFPB), Brazil", "GT-V4H, National Education and Research Network (RNP), Brazil", "Federal University of Para\u00edba (UFPB), Brazil", "Federal University of Para\u00edba (UFPB), Brazil", "GT-V4H, National Education and Research Network (RNP), Brazil"], "Conference": "IMX '22: ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences", "doi": "10.1145/3505284", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "Kauri: Scalable BFT Consensus with Pipelined Tree-Based Dissemination and Aggregation", "date": "26 October 2021", "abstract": "With the growing commercial interest in blockchains, permissioned implementations have received increasing attention. Unfortunately, the BFT consensus algorithms that are the backbone of most of these blockchains scale poorly and offer limited throughput. Many state-of-the-art algorithms require a single leader process to receive and validate votes from a quorum of processes and then broadcast the result, which is inherently non-scalable. Recent approaches avoid this bottleneck by using dissemination/aggregation trees to propagate values and collect and validate votes. However, the use of trees increases the round latency, which ultimately limits the throughput for deeper trees. In this paper we propose Kauri, a BFT communication abstraction that can sustain high throughput as the system size grows, leveraging a novel pipelining technique to perform scalable dissemination and aggregation on trees. Our evaluation shows that Kauri outperforms the throughput of state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain protocols, such as HotStuff, by up to 28x. Interestingly, in many scenarios, the parallelization provided by Kauri can also decrease the latency.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3477132.3483584", "Authors": ["Ray Neiheiser", "Miguel Matos", "Lu\u00eds Rodrigues"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387095", "nombredePage": "899  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["INESC-ID, IST, U.

This is achieved by maintaining all historical data in the database and persisting its cryptographic (SHA-256) digests in an immutable, tamper-evident ledger. Digests representing the overall state of the ledger can then be extracted and stored outside of the RDBMS to protect the data from any attacker or high privileged user, including DBAs, system and cloud administrators. The ledger and the historical data are managed transparently, offering protection without any application changes. Historical data is maintained in a relational form to support SQL queries for auditing, forensics and other purposes. SQL Ledger provides cryptographic data integrity guarantees while maintaining the power, flexibility and performance of a commercial RDBMS. In contrast to Blockchain solutions that aim for full integrity, SQL Ledger offers a form of integrity protection known as Forward Integrity.

With useful work consensus protocols, users get rewards after they have carried out some specific tasks useful for the network. While in some cases the proof of some utility or service can be provided, the majority of tasks are impossible to verify reliably. To deal with such cases, we design \u201cProof-of-Prestige\u201d (PoP)\u2014a reward system that can run directly on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains or as a smart contract on top of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains. PoP introduces \u201cprestige,\u201d which is a volatile resource that, in contrast to coins, regenerates over time. Prestige can be gained by performing useful work, spent when benefiting from services, and directly translates to users minting power. Our scheme allows us to reliably reward decentralized workers while keeping the system free for the end-users. PoP is resistant against Sybil and collusion attacks and can be used with a vast range of unverifiable tasks. We build a simulator to assess the cryptoeconomic behavior of the system and deploy a full prototype of a content dissemination platform rewarding its participants. We implement the blockchain component on both Ethereum (PoW) and Cosmos (PoS), provide a mobile application, and connect it with our scheme with a negligible memory footprint. Finally, we adapt a fair exchange protocol allowing us to atomically exchange files for rewards also in scenarios where not all the parties have Internet connectivity. Our evaluation shows that even for large Ethereum traces, PoP introduces sub-millisecond computational overhead for miners in Cosmos and less than 0.013$ smart contract invocation cost for users in Ethereum.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3419483", "Authors": ["Micha\u0142 Kr\u00f3l", "Alberto Sonnino", "Mustafa Al-Bassam", "Argyrios G.

Heterogeneous communication is a common medium for information exchange through autonomous resources distributed and accessed using infrastructure units. Cyber-Cyber-security is a primary concern in accessing autonomous information from the distributed resources due to anonymity and different types of targeted adversaries. This paper proposes token-based authorization and authentication (TAA) for securing IoV communications. The proposed method relies on blockchain technology and random forest learning for authorization and key management for authentication respectively. In this process, frequent chance in tokens and key update features are restricted in a view to maximize the seamlessness in information exchange. Authentication is preceded with the knowledge of the data classification without errors to prevent additional overhead. Blockchain based authorization helps to update specific fields of the tokens so as to retain the communication ratio by reducing vehicle-to-vehicle losses.

However, the prevalent system of data curation is atomistic resulting in policy decisions often based on point-in-time data. Additionally, most of this data resides with the industrial complex and governmental entities, and rarely with the individual citizen and civil society.

It is widely used by a growing number of businesses and individuals. However, most existing searchable encryption schemes typically overestimate the security level of the cloud server, which is an untrusted and centralized third party in fact. The emergence of blockchain technology solves the trustworthiness problem of the third party with features such as decentralization, verifiability and immutability. The combination of searchable encryption and blockchain technology uses the smart contract instead of the cloud server to execute ciphertext search task, which improves security and efficiency of search significantly. We propose a Fuzzy Multi-keyword Search Scheme for Encrypted Cloud Data based on Multi-chain Network (FMSM). FMSM is a distributed searchable encryption scheme since we adopt a multi-chain architecture. It not only supports fuzzy multi-keyword search and dynamic updates for encrypted cloud data, but also supports parallel processing of data. In FMSM, counting bloom filter and MinHash algorithm are used to construct index vectors and query vectors on the corresponding two chains, besides, the search is done on a third chain. All of these calculation tasks are executed in the way of distributed computing, which makes the index construction and search process more efficient and the sorting results more accurate. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the FMSM has high security, reliability, search efficiency and accuracy.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3458744.3474040", "Authors": ["Heng He", "chengyu Liu", "Xiaohu Zhou", "Ke Feng"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450384414", "nombredePage": "314  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology; Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System, China", "Wuhan University of Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, China", "School of Computing, Engineering, and Built Environment,Birmingham City University, United Kingdom", "School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology; Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System, China"], "Conference": "ICPP Workshops '21: 50th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshop", "doi": "10.1145/3458744", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "TangleCV: A Distributed Ledger Technique for Secure Message Sharing in Connected Vehicles", "date": "30 December 2020", "abstract": "Connected vehicles are set to define the future of transportation; however, this upcoming technology continues to be plagued with serious security risks. If these risks are not addressed in a timely fashion, then they could threaten the adoption and success of this promising technology. This article deals with a specific class of attacks in connected vehicles, namely tampering attacks caused due to compromise of on-board sensors. Current centralized solutions that employ trusted infrastructure to protect against adversarial manipulation of information cannot validate the correctness of the shared data and do not scale well. To overcome these issues, decentralized protection mechanisms by means of blockchain technology have emerged as a promising research direction. However, current permission-less, linear blockchain-based solutions have low transaction performance and high computational cost, thereby making it difficult to adopt them for security in connected vehicles. In this article, we present TangleCV, a directed acyclic graph\u2013based distributed ledger technique for connected vehicles to address data tampering threats in connected vehicular networks. We describe new validation steps, tip selection strategies, and cumulative weight definition for TangleCV that not only meets the timing constraints of the connected vehicular networks but also secures the network against threats due to tampering attacks. We describe how the reputation of the network is established in TangleCV using trust factors calculated on the basis of ability, integrity, and benevolence of the nodes in the network. We present numerical results that demonstrate that the average value of the time to first approval decreases by more than 70% as the network evolves from a low load to a high load in the case of the nearest neighbor strategy. We observe that more than 60% of the nodes are approved in a low-load network and this number increases to 80% in a high-load network for the nearest neighbor strategy.

{"title": "Traveling the token world: A graph analysis of Ethereum ERC20 token ecosystem", "date": "20 April 2020", "abstract": "The birth of Bitcoin ushered in the era of cryptocurrency, which has now become a financial market attracted extensive attention worldwide. The phenomenon of startups launching Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to raise capital led to thousands of tokens being distributed on blockchains. Many studies have analyzed this phenomenon from an economic perspective. However, little is know about the characteristics of participants in the ecosystem. To fill this gap and considering over 80% of ICOs launched based on ERC20 token on Ethereum, in this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on the whole Ethereum ERC20 token ecosystem to characterize the token creator, holder, and transfer activity. By downloading the whole blockchain and parsing the transaction records and event logs, we construct three graphs, namely token creator graph, token holder graph, and token transfer graph. We obtain many observations and findings by analyzing these graphs. Besides, we propose an algorithm to discover potential relationships between tokens and other accounts. The reported case shows that our algorithm can effectively reveal entities and the complex relationship between various accounts in the token ecosystem.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380215", "Authors": ["Weili Chen", "Tuo Zhang", "Zhiguang Chen", "Zibin Zheng", "Yutong Lu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450370233", "nombredePage": "3143  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "Conference": "WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020", "doi": "10.1145/3366423", "Total_Citations": "30"},

The underlying technology, Blockchain, shifts the responsibility for securing assets to the end-user and requires them to manage their (private) keys. Little attention has been given to how cryptocurrency users handle the challenges of key management in practice and how they select the tools to do so. To close this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=10). Our thematic analysis revealed prominent themes surrounding motivation, risk assessment, and coin management tool usage in practice. We found that the choice of tools is driven by how users assess and balance the key risks that can lead to loss: the risk of (1) human error, (2) betrayal, and (3) malicious attacks. We derive a model, explaining how risk assessment and intended usage drive the decision which tools to use.

Further, domain names are not fully controlled by users, meaning that they can easily be taken down by authorities and registrars. Due to this, there have been efforts to build a decentralized name service that gives greater control to domain owners. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a major example. Yet, no existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, particularly regarding security and misbehavior. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement study of ENS. Our findings suggest that ENS has shown growth during its four years' evolution. We identify several security issues, including traditional name system problems, as well as new issues introduced by the unique properties of ENS. We find that attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS names, a number of scam blockchain addresses and indexing of malicious websites. We further develop a new record persistence attack, to find that 22,716 .eth names (3.7% of all names) are vulnerable to name hijacking.

Although such data may be valuable, users are seldom rewarded for collecting them. Emerging digital marketplaces allow owners to advertise their data to interested buyers. We focus on geo-marketplaces, where buyers search data based on geo-tags. Such marketplaces present significant challenges. First, if owners upload data with revealed geo-tags, they expose themselves to serious privacy risks. Second, owners must be accountable for advertised data, and must not be allowed to subsequently alter geo-tags. Third, such a system may be vulnerable to intensive spam activities, where dishonest owners flood the system with fake advertisements. We propose a geo-marketplace that addresses all these concerns. We employ searchable encryption, digital commitments, and blockchain to protect the location privacy of owners while at the same time incorporating accountability and spam-resilience mechanisms. We implement a prototype with two alternative designs that obtain distinct trade-offs between trust assumptions and performance.

Therefore, the attacker can cheat concerning the provenance of an NFT and then sell the fake NFTs to unaware buyers. In this paper, we propose a study that sheds light on this phenomenon. In particular, we collect over 1.3 million events that are connected to sleepminting and analyse the events under multiple aspects.

In this article, we study the interoperability between different Hyperledger Fabrics characterized for instance by different logics, currencies or use cases. We propose a cross-Hyperledger Fabric transaction solution which enables users to complete transactions across multiple Hyperledger Fabrics safely and efficiently. We conduct a feasibility and security analysis of the proposed scheme and we propose performance analysis based on a real deployed platform. We measure the performance of our interchain communication scheme on two Hyperledger Fabrics deployed in two different cloud-based platforms (one in France and one in Germany). We evaluate the performance of the proposed inter-communication scheme in terms of end-to-end transaction delay, the intra-Hyperledger delay and the system throughput. Our experiments show that all these parameters are dependent on the network traffic and therefore open an interesting research direction related to optimal scheduling of Hyperledger Fabric intercommunication.

Specifically, when there are fewer transactions, any cryptocurrency adopting our methodology will introduce a greater inflation to motivate transactions. Moreover, this methodology provides deflations and turns the currency towards a reserve of value when the network burden is too heavy.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3205230.3205240", "Authors": ["Shuyang Tang", "Sherman S.

The Web of Things (WoT) model leverages web technologies to improve interoperability. Due to its distributed components, the web scaled well beyond initial expectations. Still, secure authentication and communication across organization boundaries rely on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which is a non-transparent, centralized single point of failure. We can improve transparency and reduce the chain of trust---thus significantly improving the IoT security---by empowering blockchain technology and web security standards.

{"title": "MatRiCT: Efficient, Scalable and Post-Quantum Blockchain Confidential Transactions Protocol", "date": "06 November 2019", "abstract": "We introduce MatRiCT, an efficient RingCT protocol for blockchain confidential transactions, whose security is based on \"post-quantum'' (module) lattice assumptions. The proof length of the protocol is around two orders of magnitude shorter than the existing post-quantum proposal, and scales efficiently to large anonymity sets, unlike the existing proposal. Further, we provide the first full implementation of a post-quantum RingCT, demonstrating the practicality of our scheme. In particular, a typical transaction can be generated in a fraction of a second and verified in about 23 ms on a standard PC. Moreover, we show how our scheme can be extended to provide auditability, where a user can select a particular authority from a set of authorities to reveal her identity. The user also has the ability to select no auditing and all these auditing options may co-exist in the same environment. The key ingredients, introduced in this work, of MatRiCT are 1) the shortest to date scalable ring signature from standard lattice assumptions with no Gaussian sampling required, 2) a novel balance zero-knowledge proof and 3) a novel extractable commitment scheme from (module) lattices. We believe these ingredients to be of independent interest for other privacy-preserving applications such as secure e-voting. Despite allowing 64-bit precision for transaction amounts, our new balance proof, and thus our protocol, does not require a range proof on a wide range (such as 32- or 64-bit ranges), which has been a major obstacle against efficient lattice-based solutions. Further, we provide new formal definitions for RingCT-like protocols, where the real-world blockchain setting is captured more closely. The definitions are applicable in a generic setting, and thus are believed to contribute to the development of future confidential transaction protocols in general (not only in the lattice setting).", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3354200", "Authors": ["Muhammed F.

{"title": "Flash: efficient dynamic routing for offchain networks", "date": "03 December 2019", "abstract": "Offchain networks emerge as a promising solution to address the scalability challenge of blockchain. Participants make payments through offchain networks instead of committing transactions on-chain. Routing is critical to the performance of offchain networks. Existing solutions use either static routing with poor performance or dynamic routing with high overhead to obtain the dynamic channel balance information. In this paper, we propose Flash, a new dynamic routing solution that leverages the unique transactions characteristics in offchain networks to strike a better tradeoff between path optimality and probing overhead. By studying the traces of real offchain networks, we find that the payment sizes are heavy-tailed, and most payments are highly recurrent. Flash thus differentiates the treatment of elephant payments from that of mice payments. It uses a modified max-flow algorithm for elephant payments to find paths with sufficient capacity, and strategically routes the payment across paths to minimize the transaction fees. Mice payments are sent directly by looking up a routing table with a few precomputed paths to reduce probing overhead. Testbed experiments and trace-driven simulations show that Flash improves the success volume of payments by up to 2.3x compared to the state-of-the-art routing algorithm.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3359989.3365411", "Authors": ["Peng Wang", "Hong Xu", "Xin Jin", "Tao Wang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450369985", "nombredePage": "395  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China", "City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China", "Johns Hopkins University", "New York University and University of Hong Kong"], "Conference": "CoNEXT '19: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Emerging Networking Experiments And Technologies", "doi": "10.1145/3359989", "Total_Citations": "24"},

As the number of drones in the sky rapidly grows, managing the expected high-volume air traffic is becoming a critical challenge. It is essential to prevent collisions, and to protect the public from nuisances like noise or invasion of privacy, and shield from hazards like falling debris. UAV traffic management should comply with regulation, spatiotemporal constraints and limitations of drones. Spatiotemporal constraints could be no-flight zones or areas where drone flight times are restricted. Drone limitations could refer to their speed, flight range, telecommunication capabilities, etc. Furthermore, managing air traffic for UAVs is very different from managing the traffic of self-driving ground vehicles. First, there are no clearly-marked roads in the sky. Second, some UAVs cannot hover and must have a cleared flight path. Third, air traffic should be managed in a 3-dimensional space.

The two strategies are not independent, of course: if everybody has the boosting technology, the difficulty will rise, and it won't be an advantage anymore. On the other hand, if the boost is above a certain threshold, being used only by a small subset of miners might mean centralizing the system, with potentially dangerous consequences on the platform credibility.

{"title": "A New Blind ECDSA Scheme for Bitcoin Transaction Anonymity", "date": "02 July 2019", "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a scenario where a bitcoin liquidity provider sells bitcoins to clients. When a client pays for a bitcoin online, the provider is able to link the client's payment information to the bitcoin sold to that client. To address the privacy concerns of clients, we require that the bitcoin provider cannot tell the relationship between the real identities of clients and the sold bitcoins in the blockchain. This requirement can be effectively achieved by using blind signatures. However, existing blind signature schemes are incompatible with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) which is used by most of the existing bitcoin protocol, thus cannot be applied directly in Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose a new blind signature scheme that allows generating a blind signature compatible with the standard ECDSA. Afterwards, we make use of the new scheme to achieve bitcoin transaction anonymity. The new scheme is built on a variant of the Paillier cryptosystem and its homomorphic properties. As long as the modified Paillier cryptosystem is semantically secure, the new blind signature scheme has blindness and unforgeability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3321705.3329816", "Authors": ["Xun Yi", "Kwok-Yan Lam"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450367523", "nombredePage": "708  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia", "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"], "Conference": "Asia CCS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3321705", "Total_Citations": "11"},

Thus, trust is ensured by DLT in a long-term perspective. Hence, one can pose the question, whether DLT is an attractive technology for long-term archiving of data. In this paper we juxtapose distributed ledger and data preservation approaches as two candidates for continuous archival workings. We show that, although the DLT seems to be a viable solution for the long-term preservation of data from a naive perspective, long time effects and efficiency considerations prevent the effective use of DLTs. We discuss hidden costs of transactions, that are not reflected in current price structures.

A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the propagation latency of blocks through the underlying peer-to-peer network, which is typically constructed by means of random connectivity. Disseminating blocks fast improves not only the transaction throughput, but also the security of the system as it reduces the probability of forks. In this paper we present CougaR: a simple yet efficient, eclipse-resistant, decentralized protocol that substantially reduces the block dissemination time in blockchain networks. CougaR's key advantages stem from its link selection policy, which combines a network latency criterion with randomness to offer fast and reliable block dissemination to the entire network. Moreover, CougaR is eclipse-resistant by design, as nodes are protected from having all their links directly or indirectly imposed on them by others, which is the typical vulnerability exploited to deploy eclipse attacks. We rigorously evaluate CougaR by an extensive set of experiments, both against a wide spectrum of parameter settings, and in comparison to the current state of the art.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3524860.3539805", "Authors": ["Evangelos Kolyvas", "Spyros Voulgaris"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450393089", "nombredePage": "210  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece", "Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece"], "Conference": "DEBS '22: Proceedings of the 16th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3524860", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Current server-based outsourcing mainly focuses on the benefits of servers. This cannot attract users well, as their security, efficiency, and economy are not guaranteed. To solve with this issue, a hybrid outsourcing model that exploits both cloud server and edge devices to store data is needed. Meanwhile, the requirements of security and efficiency are different under specific scenarios. There is a lack of a comprehensive solution that considers all of the above issues. In this work, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first hybrid user-centric data outsourcing (HUCDO) scheme. It allows users to outsource data securely, efficiently, and economically via different CPSs. Brielly, our contributions consist of theories, implementations, and evaluations. Our theories include the first homomorphic collision-resistant chameleon hash (HCCH) and homomorphic designated-receiver signcryption (HDRS).

The popularity of the \u201dgig\u201d economy has given rise to independent platforms that provide competing and complementary services. Workers as well as requesters with specific tasks may need to work for or avail from the services of multiple platforms resulting in the rise of multi-platform crowdworking systems. Recently, there has been increasing interest by governmental, legal and social institutions to enforce regulations, such as minimal and maximal work hours, on crowdworking platforms. Platforms within multi-platform crowdworking systems, therefore, need to collaborate to enforce cross-platform regulations. While collaborating to enforce global regulations requires the transparent sharing of information about tasks and their participants, the privacy of all participants needs to be preserved. In this paper, we propose an overall vision exploring the regulation, privacy, and architecture dimensions for the future of work multi-platform crowdworking environments. We then present Separ, a multi-platform crowdworking system that enforces a large sub-space of practical global regulations on a set of distributed independent platforms in a privacy-preserving manner. Separ, enforces privacy using lightweight and anonymous tokens, while transparency is achieved using fault-tolerant blockchain ledgers shared among multiple platforms.

The predominant model for digital communication is that which relies on trusted third-parties, either as local servers or as cloud services. Meanwhile, emerging technologies such as internet-of-things are set to broadcast growing amounts of potentially sensitive information thereby making centralized architectures problematic for privacy and performance reasons and making decentralized networks ever more relevant. However, these third-parties play an important role in securing brokered communications and are essential in providing Authentication and Non-Repudiation according to current models. Clearly, such an approach cannot be used in peer-to-peer networks and there is need for a simple model applicable in fully decentralized networks to provide Non-Repudiation.

Blockchains provide the benefits of a distributed ledger that can securely manage digital transactions -- where the centralisation of data is eliminated. Blockchains have recently entered as an enabling technology into the IoT market, and used in a variety of different application areas. Blockchains enable the implementation of a more trusted system capable of processing operations between IoT services and sources of data. In smart buildings, for example, Blockchains support the formation of smart contracts as a means to give transactional capabilities to IoT devices, allowing users to keep data ownership and privacy using an immutable dataset.

EdGENI introduces a desktop environment to the GENI VM and allows users to save, duplicate, and share VM environments with other users. Furthermore, EdGENI also introduces a client application, PuTTY Connect, to simplify the process of making VM connections. These features improve the user experience and extend the user base of GENI, thus delivering a generalized experiment platform for computer education.

{"title": "Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs in Routing Cryptocurrency over Payment Channel Networks", "date": "12 June 2020", "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) are viewed as one of the most promising scalability solutions for cryptocurrencies today. Roughly, PCNs are networks where each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents funds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the endpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by relaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path contains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a transaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. In deployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users for privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when routing transactions, users typically first guess a path, then check if it supports the transaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate of transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give substantial improvements in transaction success rate at the expense of privacy. In this work, we ask whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off privacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose noise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of graph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate either in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get large gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy by sacrificing a little utility.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3392147", "Authors": ["Weizhao Tang", "Weina Wang", "Giulia Fanti", "Sewoong Oh"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "2476-1249", "nombredePage": "623  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"], "Conference": "Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3405833", "Total_Citations": "7"},

We study the rate at which an attacker can execute reorgs in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake protocol. As an example, an attacker with 40% of the staking power is able to execute a 20-block malicious reorg at an average rate of once per day, and the attack probability increases super-linearly as the staking power grows beyond 40%. Moreover, an attacker of the Tezos protocol knows in advance when an attack opportunity will arise, and can use this knowledge to arrange transactions to double-spend. We show that in particular cases, the Tezos protocol can be adjusted to protect against deep reorgs. For instance, we demonstrate protocol parameters that reduce the rate of length-20 reorg opportunities for a 40% attacker by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a trade-off between optimizing for robustness to deep reorgs (costly deviations that may be net profitable because they enable double-spends) and robustness to selfish mining (mining deviations that result in typically short reorgs that are profitable even without double-spends). That is, the parameters that optimally protect against one make the other attack easy. Finally, we develop a method that monitors the Tezos blockchain health with respect to malicious reorgs using only publicly available information.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3419614.3423265", "Authors": ["Michael Neuder", "Daniel J.

{"title": "Adaptively Secure Single Secret Leader Election from DDH", "date": "21 July 2022", "abstract": "Single Secret Leader Election protocols (SSLE, for short) allow a group of users to select a random leader so that the latter remains secret until she decides to reveal herself. Thanks to this feature, SSLE can be used to build an election mechanism for proof-of-stake based blockchains. In particular, a recent work by Azouvi and Cappelletti (ACM AFT 2021) shows that in comparison to probabilistic leader election methods, SSLE-based proof-of-stake blockchains have significant security gains, both with respect to grinding attacks and with respect to the private attack. Yet, as of today, very few concrete constructions of SSLE are known. In particular, all existing protocols are only secure in a model where the adversary is supposed to corrupt participants before the protocol starts -- an assumption that clashes with the highly dynamic nature of decentralized blockchain protocols.

Each of them has a certificate authority(CA) act as a trust anchor for all the members it authorized. However, each hospital builds system according to its own understanding and form a lot of isolated domains. In medical application scenario, patients often passively need to change hospitals because of different medical levels and different diseases. For hospital cannot electronically share medical data, which cause lots of waste of resource such as repeated treatment and time consuming. The solution to medical information sharing between hospitals becomes urgent. In this paper, we propose blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for doctor users and designed corresponding protocols to support supervision department and user privacy protection. The security analysis and engineering tests demonstrate that the scheme can better meet the requirements of cross-domain authentication and provide better privacy protection services when sharing medical data.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3321408.3321574", "Authors": ["Guishan Dong", "Yuxiang Chen", "Jia Fan", "Jian Bai", "Peng Zhang", "Feng Li"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450371582", "nombredePage": "963  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chengdu, China", "China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chengdu, China", "China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chengdu, China", "China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chengdu, China", "China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chengdu, China", "China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chengdu, China"], "Conference": "ACM TURC '19: Proceedings of the ACM Turing Celebration Conference - China", "doi": "10.1145/3321408", "Total_Citations": "2"},

The advantage for users is that the funds are not in custody of a centralized external entity. However, these exchanges are prone to manipulative behavior. In this paper, we illustrate how wash trading activity can be identified on two of the first popular limit order book-based decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, IDEX and EtherDelta. We identify a lower bound of accounts and trading structures that meet the legal definitions of wash trading, discovering that they are responsible for a wash trading volume in equivalent of 159 million U.S. Dollars. While self-trades and two-account structures are predominant, complex forms also occur. We quantify these activities, finding that on both exchanges, more than 30% of all traded tokens have been subject to wash trading activity. On EtherDelta, 10% of the tokens have almost exclusively been wash traded. All data is made available for future research.

{"title": "Internet Computer Consensus", "date": "21 July 2022", "abstract": "We present the Internet Computer Consensus (ICC) family of protocols for atomic broadcast (a.k.a., consensus), which underpin the Byzantine fault-tolerant replicated state machines of the Internet Computer. The ICC protocols are leader-based protocols that assume partial synchrony, and that are fully integrated with a blockchain. The leader changes probabilistically in every round. These protocols are simple and robust: in any round where the leader is corrupt (which itself happens with probability less than 1/3) or the network is asynchronous, each ICC protocol will effectively allow other parties to step in and propose blocks for that round and to move the protocol forward to the next round. In case there was no agreement on a single block in a round, a decision for this round will be taken in a later round with synchronous network behavior and an honest leader. The task of reliably disseminating the blocks to all parties is an integral part the protocol. We present three different protocols, along with various minor variations on each. The first of these protocols (ICC0) illustrates the combination of the main building blocks in a simplified manner for an easier presentation and analysis. Protocol ICC1 is designed to be integrated with a peer-to-peer gossip sub-layer, which reduces the bottleneck created at the leader for disseminating large blocks, a problem that all leader-based protocols must address. Our Protocol ICC2 addresses the same problem by substituting a lowcommunication reliable broadcast subprotocol (which may be of independent interest) for the gossip sub-layer.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3519270.3538430", "Authors": ["Jan Camenisch", "Manu Drijvers", "Timo Hanke", "Yvonne-Anne Pignolet", "Victor Shoup", "Dominic Williams"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450392624", "nombredePage": "509  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["DFINITY Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland", "DFINITY Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland", "DFINITY Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland", "DFINITY Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland", "DFINITY Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland", "DFINITY Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland"], "Conference": "PODC'22: Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3519270", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "BC-IoDT: blockchain-based framework for authentication in internet of drone things", "date": "24 October 2022", "abstract": "We leverage blockchain technology for drone node authentication in internet of drone things (IoDT). During the authentication procedure, the credentials of drone nodes are examined to remove malicious nodes from the system. In IoDT, drones are responsible for gathering data and transmitting it to cluster heads (CHs) for further processing. The CH collects and organizes data. Due to computational load, their energy levels rapidly deplete. To overcome this problem, we present a low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (R2D) protocol based on distance, degree, and residual energy. R2D is used to replace CHs with normal nodes based on the biggest residual energy, the degree, and the shortest distance from BS. The cost of keeping a big volume of data on the blockchain is high. We employ the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), to address this issue. Moreover, IPFS protects user data using the industry-standard encryption technique AES-128. This standard compares well to other current encryption methods. Using a consensus mechanism based on proof of work requires a high amount of computing resources for transaction verification. The suggested approach leverages a consensus mechanism known as proof of authority (PoA) to address this problem. The results of the simulations indicate that the suggested system model functions effectively and efficiently.

They serve as effective hedging tools and improve economic development, but conversely are complicated and subject to heavy regulation. Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) enables a distributed, trustworthy ledger that stores encrypted information. It could enable frictionless, transparent, financial derivative processing by creating an inherently trustworthy ecosystem that eliminates the need for transaction verification. This paper discusses how different DLT protocols could facilitate financial derivatives. We then present a protocol for facilitating financial derivatives using Stellar's DLT protocol. Assessing our protocol shows that it processes derivatives efficiently with complete transparency. Comparing our DLT based derivatives to traditional derivatives affirms our belief that DLT enables an increase in transparency and reduction of market friction. However, we also found that DLT based derivatives have increased security and counterparty risk. Overall, if the developer mitigates the risks associated with DLT, our protocol could enable a level 3 blockchain application to improve the financial derivatives ecosystem significantly.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3399871.3399904", "Authors": ["Markus Paulson-Luna", "Ken Reily"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450377102", "nombredePage": "163  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Carlson School of Management, Minneapolis, MN", "Carlson School of Management, Minneapolis, MN"], "Conference": "ASSE '20: Proceedings of the 2020 Asia Service Sciences and Software Engineering Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3399871", "Total_Citations": "0"},

However, privacy is a major obstacle to the wide-spread use of such apps since users are concerned about sharing their contact and diagnosis data. This research overcomes multiple challenges facing contact tracing apps: (1) As researchers have pointed out, there is a need to balance contact tracing effectiveness with the amount of user identity and diagnosis information shared. (2) No matter what information the user chooses to share, the app should safeguard the privacy of user information. (3) On the other hand, some essential test result information must be shared for the contact tracing app to work. While contact tracing apps have done a good job maintaining contact information on the user\u2019s device, most such apps publish positive COVID-19 test results to a central server which have some risks for compromise. We address these challenges by (1) giving the user the right to choose how much information to share about their diagnosis and their identity, (2) building our novel contact tracing app on top of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to assure privacy preserving user authentication with verifiable credentials, and (3) decentralizing the storage of COVID-19 test results.

{"title": "Solving the cold start problem in Trust Management in IoT", "date": "17 August 2021", "abstract": "Internet of Things has a profound effect on everyday life and critical vertical services including healthcare, factories of the future and intelligent transport systems. The highly distributed nature of such networks and the heterogeneity of the devices, which constitute them, necessitates that their users should be able to trust them at all times. A method to determine the device's service trustworthiness is Trust Management (TM), which assigns scores to devices according to their trustworthiness level, based on evaluations from other entities that interacted with it. Often Internet of Things devices that just joined the network, have not interacted with any other entity of this network before, hence there is no way to determine its trustworthiness. Such an event is referred to as the cold start trust score or initial trust score problem. The majority of the trust management approaches address this problem by setting an arbitrary initial trust score, while others will ignore it. Assigning arbitrary trust scores for devices connected to the network for the first time has the potential to disrupt the operation of the entire system, when a high trust score is assigned to a non-trusted malicious device, or lead to unfair policies, when trusted devices are assumed as potential intruders, which also deteriorates the performance of the system. This paper proposes a mechanism, which combines the blockchain based BARRETT remote attestation protocol with a set of device's properties and communication and operational context parameters, in order to determine accurately and assign the initial trust score to each device. Through a set of extensive simulations over different experimental setups, the proposed scheme is achieving to safely distribute initial trust scores to one thousand devices over less than 6ms, while minimising the risk of computational denial of service attacks due to the inherent characteristics of the BARRETT remote attestation protocol.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3465481.3469208", "Authors": ["Michail Bampatsikos", "Ilias Politis", "Christos Xenakis", "Stelios C.

In addition, our scheme is hiding: a commitment and proofs for some values reveal no information about the remaining values.

In our example application, Pointproofs reduce bandwidth overheads for propagating a block of transactions by at least 60% compared to prior state- of-art vector commitments.

Client puzzles have been proposed to mitigate DoS attacks by requiring a client to prove legitimate intentions. Since its introduction, there have been several constructions of client puzzles. Nevertheless, most of the existing client puzzles are interactive, where a server constructs a puzzle for a client request and asks the client to solve it before giving access to a resource. Additionally, most existing client puzzles do not provide desirable properties such as fairness, non-parallelizability, or non-interactivity. In this work, we propose a non-interactive client puzzle that achieves all these desired properties through a verifiable delay function (VDF). In a non-interactive puzzle, the client generates a puzzle and sends its solution along with the puzzle to access a resource of the server. We present different methods to generate verifiable client puzzles to prevent puzzle forgery and attacks from the client side. Further, we exhibit a transformation of the client puzzle into a DoS-resistant protocol.

{"title": "The Consensus Number of a Cryptocurrency", "date": "16 July 2019", "abstract": "Many blockchain-based algorithms, such as Bitcoin, implement a decentralized asset transfer system, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. As stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of preventing double-spending ; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on the order of transfers among the participants. By treating the asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determining its consensus number, we show that consensus is not necessary to prevent double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where only a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account. Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that the consensus number of an asset transfer object is 1. We then consider a more general k-shared asset transfer object where up to k processes can atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has consensus number k. We first establish these these results in the context of shared memory with benign faults, in order to properly understand the level of difficulty of the asset transfer problem. Then, we translate our result in the more practically relevant message passing setting with Byzantine players. We describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art consensus-based solutions.

This novel approach can seriously offer a breakthrough to accounting and finance big data management [2][3].

{"title": "Refiner: a reliable incentive-driven federated learning system powered by blockchain", "date": "28 October 2021", "abstract": "Modern mobile applications often produce decentralized data, i.e., a huge amount of privacy-sensitive data distributed over a large number of mobile devices. Techniques for learning models from decentralized data must properly handle two natures of such data, namely privacy and massive engagement. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for such a learning task since the technique learns models from data without exposing privacy. However, traditional FL methods assume that the participating mobile devices are honest volunteers. This assumption makes traditional FL methods unsuitable for applications where two kinds of participants are engaged: 1) self-interested participants who, without economical stimulus, are reluctant to contribute their computing resources unconditionally, and 2) malicious participants who send corrupt updates to disrupt the learning process. This paper proposes Refiner, a reliable federated learning system for tackling the challenges introduced by massive engagements of self-interested and malicious participants. Refiner is built upon Ethereum, a public blockchain platform. To engage self-interested participants, we introduce an incentive mechanism which rewards each participant in terms of the amount of its training data and the performance of its local updates. To handle malicious participants, we propose an audit scheme which employs a committee of randomly chosen validators for punishing them with no reward and preclude corrupt updates from the global model. The proposed incentive and audit scheme is implemented with cryptocurrency and smart contract, two primitives offered by Ethereum. This paper demonstrates the main features of Refiner by training a digit classification model on the MNIST dataset.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.14778/3476311.3476313", "Authors": ["Zhebin Zhang", "Dajie Dong", "Yuhang Ma", "Yilong Ying", "Dawei Jiang", "Ke Chen", "Lidan Shou", "Gang Chen"], "Publisher": "VLDB Endowment", "publisherAddress": null, "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "2150-8097", "nombredePage": "587  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University", "Zhejiang University"], "Conference": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "doi": ",", "Total_Citations": "1"},

In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains.

We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality.

{"title": "Vertically Disintegrated Platforms", "date": "13 July 2020", "abstract": "Understanding the implications of digital platform strategies on user welfare has become a crucial issue for policy makers and economists alike. In payments, distributed ledger technologies such as the blockchain have introduced new models of platform governance in the form of vertically disintegrated platforms (VDP). In this paper, we develop a framework to study the implications of vertical disintegration on user welfare. A VDP mediates between users and processors that enable interactions between users. The VDP controls the price structure but the price level is set in a competitive equilibrium between processors; proceeds from operating the platform service are split between processors and the VDP. We find that the welfare ordering between traditional (integrated) and disintegrated platforms crucially depends on the platform cost structure and the regulatory conditions in the market for processors. When the cost of integrating processors depends on the transaction volume, the VDP can produce higher welfare. In contrast, when this cost is fixed, an unregulated VDP is less desirable than the integrated platform. However, regulatory limits on the VDP power over processors can make user welfare under a VDP dominate. Within our framework, we analyze recent applications in the payment industry, including central bank digital currencies, and show how different design choices affect user welfare.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3391403.3399492", "Authors": ["Christoph Aymanns", "Mathias Dewatripont", "Tarik Roukny"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["abstract"], "ISBN": "9781450379755", "nombredePage": "937  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of St Gallen, QuantCo & Systemic Risk Centre LSE, Munich, Germany", "Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, CEPR, Brussels, Belgium", "KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"], "Conference": "EC '20: Proceedings of the 21st ACM Conference on Economics and Computation", "doi": "10.1145/3391403", "Total_Citations": "1"},

Such clients can be embedded within other blockchains by implementing them as smart contracts, allowing for cross-chain verification. One such interesting instance is the consumption of Bitcoin data within Ethereum by implementing a Bitcoin superlight client in Solidity. While such theoretical constructions have demonstrated security and efficiency in theory, no practical implementation exists. In this work, we put forth the first practical Solidity implementation of a superlight client which implements the NIPoPoW superblocks protocol. Contrary to previous work, our Solidity smart contract achieves sufficient gas-efficiency to allow a proof and counter-proof to fit within the gas limit of a block, making it practical. We provide extensive experimental measurements for gas consumption. The optimizations that enable gas-efficiency heavily leverage a novel technique which we term hash-and-resubmit, which almost completely eliminates persistent storage requirements, the most expensive operation of smart contracts in terms of gas. Instead, the contract asks contesters to resubmit data and checks their veracity by hashing it. Other optimizations include off-chain manipulation of proofs in order to remove expensive look-up structures, and the usage of an optimistic schema. We show that such techniques can be used to bring down gas costs significantly and may be of independent interest. Lastly, our implementation allows us to calculate concrete cryptoeconomic parameters for the superblocks NIPoPoWs protocol and in particular to make recommendations about the monetary value of the collateral parameters.

In this new model, referred to as the append memory model, nodes are allowed to write new values to the unordered memory, but not to overwrite already existing values. We show that although this model differs from the standard shared memory model with n shared read-write registers, many known results from the shared memory model still hold in the append memory model: It is, for example, impossible to establish consensus on n nodes with one crash failure if the nodes in the system are asynchronous. We also consider the append memory model in a synchronous setting with Byzantine failures. For this case, we show that Byzantine agreement cannot be solved in less than t+1 rounds, where t is the number of Byzantine nodes in the system. Assuming a probabilistic access restriction to the append memory, we compare the Byzantine agreement protocols on the Chain and the DAG. We show that the DAG structure achieves an almost optimal resilience (close to t<n/2) in contrast to the Chain structure that can tolerate less than t<n/(1+l*(n-t)) Byzantine nodes, where l is the rate at which the nodes access the memory.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3350755.3400272", "Authors": ["Darya Melnyk", "Roger Wattenhofer"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450369350", "nombredePage": "601  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"], "Conference": "SPAA '20: Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures", "doi": "10.1145/3350755", "Total_Citations": "1"},
{"title": "Clock Design Methodology for Energy and Computation Efficient Bitcoin Mining Machines", "date": "13 April 2022", "abstract": "Bitcoin mining machines become a new driving force to push the physical limitation of semiconductor process technology. Instead of peak performance, mining machines pursue energy and computation efficiency of implementing cryptographic hash functions. Therefore, the state-of-the-art ASIC design of mining machines adopts near-threshold computing, deep pipelines, and uni-directional data flow. According to these design properties, in this paper, we propose a novel clock reversing tree design methodology for bitcoin mining machines. In the clock reversing tree, the clock of global tree is fed from the last pipeline stage backward to the first one, and the clock latency difference between the local clock roots of two consecutive stages maintains a constant delay. The local tree of each stage is well balanced and keeps the same clock latency. The special clock topology naturally utilizes setup time slacks to gain hold time margins. Moreover, to alleviate the incurred on-chip variations due to near-threshold computing, we maximize the common clock path shared by flip-flops of each individual stage. Finally, we perform inverter pair swap to maintain duty cycle. Experimental results show that our methodology is promising for industrial bitcoin mining designs: Compared with two variation-aware clock network synthesis approaches widely used in modern ASIC designs, our approach can reduce up to 64% clock buffer/inverter usage, 12% clock power, decrease 99% hold time violating paths, and achieve 85% area saving for timing fixing.

Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience unexpected delays and evictions unless a substantial fee is offered. In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries.

{"title": "zkay: Specifying and Enforcing Data Privacy in Smart Contracts", "date": "06 November 2019", "abstract": "Privacy concerns of smart contracts are a major roadblock preventing their wider adoption. A promising approach to protect private data is hiding it with cryptographic primitives and then enforcing correctness of state updates by Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) proofs. Unfortunately, NIZK statements are less expressive than smart contracts, forcing developers to keep some functionality in the contract. This results in scattered logic, split across contract code and NIZK statements, with unclear privacy guarantees. To address these problems, we present the zkay language, which introduces privacy types defining owners of private values. zkay contracts are statically type checked to (i) ensure they are realizable using NIZK proofs and (ii) prevent unintended information leaks. Moreover, the logic of zkay contracts is easy to follow by just ignoring privacy types. To enforce zkay contracts, we automatically transform them into contracts equivalent in terms of privacy and functionality, yet executable on public blockchains. We evaluated our approach on a proof-of-concept implementation generating Solidity contracts and implemented 10 interesting example contracts in zkay. Our results indicate that zkay is practical: On-chain cost for executing the transformed contracts is around 1M gas per transaction (~0.50US$) and off-chain cost is moderate.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3363222", "Authors": ["Samuel Steffen", "Benjamin Bichsel", "Mario Gersbach", "Noa Melchior", "Petar Tsankov", "Martin Vechev"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450367479", "nombredePage": "2755  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"], "Conference": "CCS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3319535", "Total_Citations": "21"},
{"title": "On the Difficulty of Hiding the Balance of Lightning Network Channels", "date": "02 July 2019", "abstract": "The Lightning Network is a second layer technology running on top of Bitcoin and other Blockchains. It is composed of a peer-to-peer network, used to transfer raw information data. Some of the links in the peer-to-peer network are identified as payment channels, used to conduct payments between two Lightning Network clients (i.e., the two nodes of the channel). Payment channels are created with a fixed credit amount, the channel capacity. The channel capacity, together with the IP address of the nodes, is published to allow a routing algorithm to find an existing path between two nodes that do not have a direct payment channel. However, to preserve users' privacy, the precise balance of the pair of nodes of a given channel (i.e. the bandwidth of the channel in each direction), is kept secret. Since balances are not announced, second-layer nodes probe routes iteratively, until they find a successful route to the destination for the amount required, if any. This feature makes the routing discovery protocol less efficient but preserves the privacy of channel balances. In this paper, we present an attack to disclose the balance of a channel in the Lightning Network. Our attack is based on performing multiple payments ensuring that none of them is finalized, minimizing the economical cost of the attack.

While BFT protocols have the potential to create highly resilient infrastructures, some questions yet remain to be answered.

However, due to the limitation of edge resources and the diversity of edge resource providers, there is no good mechanism to solve the resource allocation problem in the edge computing resource allocation market. Aiming at the problem of resource allocation in edge computing, this paper proposes a double auction scheme-DPODA. This scheme establishes the auction market of edge computing resources, which can improve the social welfare of auction to the maximum extent. Moreover, as the private information of users in the auction market may affect market transactions, in order to solve this problem, this paper uses differential privacy technology to effectively protect the privacy of both sides of the auction, so as to avoid the unfairness in the auction market.

It is common that attackers add adversarial perturbation to a normal image in order to fool the models. The N-pixel attack is one of the recently popular adversarial methods by simply changing a few pixels in the image. We observe that changing the few pixels leads to an obvious difference with its neighboring pixels. Therefore, this research aims to defend the N-pixel attacks based on image reconstruction. We develop a three-staged reconstructing algorithm to recover the fooling images. Experimental results show that the accuracy of CIFAR-10 test dataset can reach 92% after applying our proposed algorithm, indicating that the algorithm can maintain the original inference accuracy on normal dataset. Besides, the effectiveness of defending N-pixel attacks is also validated by reconstructing 500 attacked images using the proposed algorithm.

{"title": "Testing Smart Contracts: Which Technique Performs Best?", "date": "11 October 2021", "abstract": "Background: Executing, verifying and enforcing credible transactions on permissionless blockchains is done using smart contracts. A key challenge with smart contracts is ensuring their correctness and security. Several test input generation techniques for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts have been proposed in the last few years. However, a comparison of proposed techniques to gauge their effectiveness is missing. Aim: This paper conducts an empirical evaluation of testing techniques for smart contracts. The testing techniques we evaluated are: (1) Blackbox fuzzing, (2) Adaptive fuzzing, (3) Coverage-guided fuzzing with an SMT solver and (4) Genetic algorithm. We do not consider static analysis tools, as several recent studies have assessed and compared effectiveness of these tools. Method: We evaluate effectiveness of the test generation techniques using (1) Coverage achieved - we use four code coverage metrics targeting smart contracts, (2) Fault finding ability - using artificially seeded and real security vulnerabilities of different types. We used two datasets in our evaluation - one with 1665 real smart contracts from Etherscan, and another with 90 real contracts with known vulnerabilities to assess fault finding ability. Result: We find Adaptive fuzzing performs best in terms of coverage and fault finding over contracts in both datasets.

{"title": "Incentive Mechanism for Social Network Data Pricing under Privacy Preservation", "date": "06 October 2020", "abstract": "Online social networks have become very important sources of personal data that contain preferences, tastes, interests and friendships of their users. The potential that these data may be exploited poses a rising concern over how privacy is protected by these social network platforms. As a consequence, users are starting to demand privacy protection and privacy compensation when their data are used. This situation begs the question: How to properly compensate social network users for the disclosure of their data hosted in the network while preserving their privacy? In this paper, we consider data trade between a large amount of privacy-aware social network users, and a data broker with a budget who wants to find out aggregate friendship information of this social network.

{"title": "SAMPL: Scalable Auditability of Monitoring Processes using Public Ledgers", "date": "06 November 2019", "abstract": "Organized surveillance, especially by governments poses a major challenge to individual privacy, due to the resources governments have at their disposal, and the possibility of overreach. Given the impact of invasive monitoring, in most democratic countries, government surveillance is, in theory, monitored and subject to public oversight to guard against violations. In practice, there is a difficult fine balance between safeguarding individual's privacy rights and not diluting the efficacy of national security investigations, as exemplified by reports on government surveillance programs that have caused public controversy, and have been challenged by civil and privacy rights organizations. Surveillance is generally conducted through a mechanism where federal agencies obtain a warrant from a federal or state judge (e.g., the US FISA court, Supreme Court in Canada) to subpoena a company or service-provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft) for their customers' data. The courts provide annual statistics on the requests (accepted, rejected), while the companies provide annual transparency reports for public auditing. However, in practice, the statistical information provided by the courts and companies is at a very high level, generic, is released after-the-fact, and is inadequate for auditing the operations. Often this is attributed to the lack of scalable mechanisms for reporting and transparent auditing. In this paper, we present SAMPL, a novel auditing framework which leverages cryptographic mechanisms, such as zero knowledge proofs, Pedersen commitments, Merkle trees, and public ledgers to create a scalable mechanism for auditing electronic surveillance processes involving multiple actors. SAMPL is the first framework that can identify the actors (e.g., agencies and companies) that violate the purview of the court orders. We experimentally demonstrate the scalability for SAMPL for handling concurrent monitoring processes without undermining their secrecy and auditability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3354219", "Authors": ["Gaurav Panwar", "Roopa Vishwanathan", "Satyajayant Misra", "Austin Bos"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450367479", "nombredePage": "2755  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA", "New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA", "New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA", "New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"], "Conference": "CCS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3319535", "Total_Citations": "3"},

{"title": "Effects of a Simple Relay Network on the Bitcoin Network", "date": "07 August 2019", "abstract": "Bitcoin has a low transaction throughput. In order to allow for an increase of this throughput without increasing orphan blocks, decreasing the block propagation time is important. One of the techniques to improve its block propagation time is to utilize relay networks. However, the effects of utilizing relay networks is not apparent. Existing studies and measurements on relay networks have not focused on the effect of relay networks on the individual miners. Moreover, the relation between the degree of the effect and relay network utilization rate is unknown. Herein, we performed simulations while finely changing the proportion of nodes utilizing a relay network. Moreover we quantitatively evaluated the effect of relay networks on the entire Bitcoin network and individual miners. Results show that the propagation time decrease to approximately 77% of the original value if the utilization rate is set to 3%. This rate is close to the actual utilization rate of relay network \"Falcon\". We also found that the probability of blocks created by utilizing nodes to become orphan blocks is surprisingly smaller than that of the non-utilizing nodes. Even in the worst case, the value of utilizing nodes is 15% of the value of non-utilizing nodes.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3340422.3343640", "Authors": ["Kai Otsuki", "Yusuke Aoki", "Ryohei Banno", "Kazuyuki Shudo"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450368490", "nombredePage": "60  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan", "Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan", "Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan", "Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"], "Conference": "AINTEC '19: Proceedings of the Asian Internet Engineering Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3340422", "Total_Citations": "13"},
{"title": "PrivateEx: privacy preserving exchange of crypto-assets on blockchain", "date": "30 March 2020", "abstract": "Bitcoin introduces a new type of cryptocurrency that does not rely on a central system to maintain transactions. Inspired by the success of Bitcoin, all types of alt cryptocurrencies were invented in recent years. Some of the new cryptocurrencies focus on privacy enhancement, where transaction information such as value and sender/receiver identity can be hidden, such as Zcash and Monero. However, there are few schemes to support multiple types of cryptocurrencies/assets and offer privacy enhancement at the same time. The major challenge for a multiple asset system is that it needs to support two-way assets exchange between participants besides one-way asset transfer. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving exchange scheme, PrivateEx, which preserves the privacy of the exchange of different assets. PrivateEx utilizes zero-knowledge proof and a novel way to \"lock\" assets involved in the exchange to guarantee the correctness, fairness, and privacy of exchange of assets in the system.

{"title": "Trade or Trick?: Detecting and Characterizing Scam Tokens on Uniswap Decentralized Exchange", "date": "15 December 2021", "abstract": "The prosperity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem drives the need for digital asset trading platforms. Beyond centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are introduced to allow users to trade cryptocurrency without transferring the custody of their digital assets to the middlemen, thus eliminating the security and privacy issues of traditional CEX. Uniswap, as the most prominent cryptocurrency DEX, is continuing to attract scammers, with fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take the first step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first collect all the transactions related to Uniswap V2 exchange and investigate the landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives. Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap based on a guilt-by-association heuristic and a machine-learning powered technique. We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on Uniswap, which suggests that roughly 50% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam tokens and liquidity pools are created specialized for the \"rug pull\" scams, and some scam tokens have embedded tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts. We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help carry out the scams in league with the scam token/pool creators. The scammers have gained a profit of at least $16 million from 39,762 potential victims. Our observations in this paper suggest the urgency to identify and stop scams in the decentralized finance ecosystem, and our approach can act as a whistleblower that identifies scam tokens at their early stages.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3491051", "Authors": ["Pengcheng Xia", "Haoyu Wang", "Bingyu Gao", "Weihang Su", "Zhou Yu", "Xiapu Luo", "Chao Zhang", "Xusheng Xiao", "Guoai Xu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "2476-1249", "nombredePage": "435  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China", "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HongKong, China", "Tsinghua University, Beijing, China", "Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA", "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"], "Conference": "Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3506735", "Total_Citations": "4"},

{"title": "An Implement of Smart Contract Based Decentralized Online Crowdsourcing Mechanism", "date": "08 December 2018", "abstract": "With the gradual promotion, crowdsourcing has become an efficient way to solve problems that are very complicated for computers and simple for human crowd intelligence in recent years. Traditional crowdsourcing is based on a central system where requesters post tasks on a crowdsourcing central server or platform, however, this centralized model currently faces various challenges such as prohibitive cost, single point of failure, and vulnerability to malicious attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a smart contract-based decentralized online crowdsourcing mechanism, which includes task assignment rules and reward payment rules, etc. The mechanism has the characteristics like decentralization, unalterable, truthfulness and so on. In addition, the corresponding smart contract is designed, so that the mechanism can really run and process the actual data, and the effectiveness is shown by experiments. In this way, the entire crowdsourcing process no longer requires the participation of trusted third-party agencies, information and privacy security is guaranteed, and the cost is lower.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3297156.3297239", "Authors": ["Yonggen Gu", "Jiashen Chen", "Xiaohong Wu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450366069", "nombredePage": "641  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou, Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, School of Information, Engineering, Huzhou University, Huzhou, China", "School of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou, Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China", "School of Information, Engineering, Huzhou, University, Huzhou, China"], "Conference": "CSAI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence", "doi": "10.1145/3297156", "Total_Citations": "3"},

{"title": "BFastPay: A Routing-free Protocol for Fast Payment in Bitcoin Network", "date": "26 April 2021", "abstract": "Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency which supports payment services via the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. However, Bitcoin suffers from a fundamental problem. In practice, a secure Bitcoin transaction requires the payee to wait for at least 6 block confirmations (one hour) to be validated. Such a long waiting time thwarts the wide deployment of the Bitcoin payment services because many usage scenarios require a much shorter waiting time. In this paper, we propose BFastPay to accelerate the Bitcoin payment validation. BFastPay employs a smart contract called BFPayArbitrator to host the payer's security deposit and fulfills the role of a trusted payment arbitrator which guarantees that a payee always receives the payment even if attacks occur. BFastpay is a routing-free solution that eliminates the requirement for payment routing in the traditional payment routing network (e.g., Lightning Network). The theoretical and experimental results show that BFast is able to significantly reduce the Bitcoin payment waiting time (e.g., from 60 mins to less than 1 second) with nearly no extra operation cost.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3422337.3447823", "Authors": ["Xinyu Lei", "Guan-Hua Tu", "Tian Xie", "Sihan Wang"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450381437", "nombredePage": "348  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA", "Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA", "Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA", "Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"], "Conference": "CODASPY '21: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy", "doi": "10.1145/3422337", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Credit networks like Ripple and Stellar are increasingly popular, and can facilitate crosscurrency transactions in a fraction of the time it would take for banks or other financial institutions to process the same transaction, and at a fraction of the cost. Unlike for cryptocurrencies, there has been little work in the area of designing secure and private mixers for credit networks. Mixers for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin cannot be directly applied to the credit network domain because credit networks have an inherently different structure and purpose than cryptocurrencies. We design a system that uses cryptographic constructs such as ring signatures, commitments, and zero knowledge proofs to provide security/integrity of all transactions, ensures privacy of the users involved in a transaction, as well as privacy of the amount transacted.

To conduct this investigation, we train machine learning models for this prediction, taking into consideration carefully balanced sets of confirmed and failed transactions.

{"title": "Verifiable Computation using Smart Contracts", "date": "11 November 2019", "abstract": "Outsourcing computation has been widely used to allow weak clients to access computational resources of a cloud. A natural security requirement for the client is to be able to efficiently verify the received computation result. An attractive approach to verifying a general computation is to send the computation to multiple clouds, and use carefully designed protocols to compare the results and achieve verifiability. This however requires a Trusted Third Party (TTP) to manage the interactions of the client and the clouds. Our goal is to employ a smart contract to act as the TTP. This also relieves the client from directly interacting with the clouds, and engaging in possibly a complex stateful protocol. We focus on a verifiable computation protocol of Canetti, Riva and Rothbulm (CRR) with provable security against a malicious cloud, and show that direct employment of the protocol with a smart contract will result in an attack that will undermine the security of the system. We describe and analyze the attack, and extend CRR protocol to protect against this attack, resulting in a secure verifiable computation system using smart contracts. We also give the pseudocode of a smart contract and the required functions that can be used to implement the protocol, written in the Solidity language, and explain its working.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3338466.3358925", "Authors": ["Sepideh Avizheh", "Mahmudun Nabi", "Reihaneh Safavi-Naini", "Muni Venkateswarlu K."], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450368261", "nombredePage": "209  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada", "University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada", "University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada", "University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"], "Conference": "CCSW'19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Cloud Computing Security Workshop", "doi": "10.1145/3338466", "Total_Citations": "7"},

The capital owned by TNCs makes it possible to participate in the research and development of new technologies in order to increase the efficiency of their functioning and competitiveness in the market. In the era of digitalization, these corporations invest heavily in the development of modern software solutions and their implementation in the workflow. The transfer of documents into electronic format and conducting most of the daily activity on-line speaks about the virtualization of processes occurring in TNCs. The activities of these companies either completely go into the sphere of virtual reality, or partly when the company still produces a material product or organizes its delivery from a sender to a consignee. The purpose of this article is to describe the evolution of the electronic document management in TNC and to evaluate possibilities of applicability of the electronic document management of TNC in the everyday activity of the state bodies. The Danish TNC Maersk (the sea line, which is the leader in the field of container shipping) was chosen as an empirical basis for the research. Obtaining insider information about the functioning of these information systems was made possible thanks to a series of interviews with current and former employees of Maersk.

{"title": "Cyclic Arbitrage in Decentralized Exchanges", "date": "16 August 2022", "abstract": "Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) enable users to create markets for exchanging any pair of cryptocurrencies. The direct exchange rate of two tokens may not match the cross-exchange rate in the market, and such price discrepancies open up arbitrage possibilities with trading through different cryptocurrencies cyclically. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on cyclic arbitrages in DEXes. We propose a theoretical framework for studying cyclic arbitrage. With our framework, we analyze the profitability conditions and optimal trading strategies of cyclic transactions. We further examine exploitable arbitrage opportunities and the market size of cyclic arbitrages with transaction-level data of Uniswap V2. We find that traders have executed 292,606 cyclic arbitrages over eleven months and exploited more than 138 million USD in revenue. However, the revenue of the most profitable unexploited opportunity is persistently higher than 1 ETH (4,000 USD), which indicates that DEX markets may not be efficient enough.

{"title": "Tracking Counterfeit Cryptocurrency End-to-end", "date": "15 June 2021", "abstract": "The production of counterfeit money has a long history. It refers to the creation of imitation currency that is produced without the legal sanction of government. With the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there is expanding evidence that counterfeit cryptocurrency has also appeared. In this paper, we empirically explore the presence of counterfeit cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and measure their impact. By analyzing over 190K ERC-20 tokens (or cryptocurrencies) on Ethereum, we have identified $2,117$ counterfeit tokens that target 94 of the 100 most popular cryptocurrencies. We perform an end-to-end characterization of the counterfeit token ecosystem, including their popularity, creators and holders, fraudulent behaviors and advertising channels. Through this, we have identified two types of scams related to counterfeit tokens and devised techniques to identify such scams. We observe that over 7,104 victims were deceived in these scams, and the overall financial loss sums to a minimum of \\$ 17 million (74,271.7 ETH).

Under this approach, the security of mining in RANC achieves near-perfect incentive compatibility, and near-zero censorship susceptibility, for adversarial mining shares up to 45%, but at the cost of regression in subversion-gain resilience. Moreover, mining rewards in RANC exhibit significantly lower variance for non-majority miners compared to NC, enabling dependable reward stability. Consequently, depending on the network transaction-fees, RANC improves miner's waiting time for rewards, and incentivizes forming mining pools smaller than required in Bitcoin for equal reward stability.

In the second part of the paper we check for the presence of subliminal channels in the zk-SNARK protocol and in Pedersen Commitments. We show presence of efficient 70-bit channels which could be used for tagging of shielded transactions which would allow the attacker (malicious transaction verifier) to link transactions issued by a maliciously modified zk-SNARK prover, while would be indistinguishable from regular transactions for the honest verifier/user.

{"title": "The Honey Badger of BFT Protocols", "date": "24 October 2016", "abstract": "The surprising success of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge of interest in deploying large scale, highly robust, Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols for mission-critical applications, such as financial transactions. Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario. We present an alternative, HoneyBadgerBFT, the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which guarantees liveness without making any timing assumptions. We base our solution on a novel atomic broadcast protocol that achieves optimal asymptotic efficiency. We present an implementation and experimental results to show our system can achieve throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second, and scales to over a hundred nodes on a wide area network. We even conduct BFT experiments over Tor, without needing to tune any parameters.

Architectural migration is an important activity that helps to transform the architectural styles applied during a system\u2019s design with the result of modernising the system. If not performed correctly, this process could lead to potential system failures. This article presents an automated approach to refactoring architectural design and to planning the evolution process. With our solution, the architectural design can be refactored, ensuring that system functionality is preserved. Furthermore, the architectural migration process allows the system to be safely and incrementally transformed. We have evaluated our approach with five real-world software applications. The results prove the effectiveness of our approach and identify factors that impact the performance of architectural verification and migration planning. An interesting finding is that planning algorithms generate migration plans that differ in term of their relative efficiency.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3461011", "Authors": ["Nacha Chondamrongkul", "Jing Sun", "Ian Warren"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "1049-331X", "nombredePage": "613  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Information Technology, Mae Fah Luang University, Thailand", "School of Computer Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand", "School of Computer Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology", "doi": "1557-7392", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "OneFi: One-Shot Recognition for Unseen Gesture via COTS WiFi", "date": "15 November 2021", "abstract": "WiFi-based Human Gesture Recognition (HGR) becomes increasingly promising for device-free human-computer interaction. However, existing WiFi-based approaches have not been ready for real-world deployment due to the limited scalability, especially for unseen gestures. The reason behind is that when introducing unseen gestures, prior works have to collect a large number of samples and re-train the model. While the recent advance of few-shot learning has brought new opportunities to solve this problem, the overhead has not been effectively reduced. This is because these methods still require enormous data to learn adequate prior knowledge, and their complicated training process intensifies the regular training cost. In this paper, we propose a WiFi-based HGR system, namely OneFi, which can recognize unseen gestures with only one (or few) labeled samples. OneFi fundamentally addresses the challenge of high overhead. On the one hand, OneFi utilizes a virtual gesture generation mechanism such that the massive efforts in prior works can be significantly alleviated in the data collection process. On the other hand, OneFi employs a lightweight one-shot learning framework based on transductive fine-tuning to eliminate model re-training. We additionally design a self-attention based backbone, termed as WiFi Transformer, to minimize the training cost of the proposed framework. We establish a real-world testbed using commodity WiFi devices and perform extensive experiments over it. The evaluation results show that OneFi can recognize unseen gestures with the accuracy of 84.2, 94.2, 95.8, and 98.8% when 1, 3, 5, 7 labeled samples are available, respectively, while the overall training process takes less than two minutes.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3485730.3485936", "Authors": ["Rui Xiao", "Jianwei Liu", "Jinsong Han", "Kui Ren"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450390972", "nombredePage": "686  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China", "Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China", "Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China and Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Cyberspace Governance of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang, China", "Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China and Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Cyberspace Governance of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang, China"], "Conference": "SenSys '21: Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3485730", "Total_Citations": "2"},

Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks and, thereby, DeFi protocols would be affected.

We present an optimization problem that jointly determines the location of the UAV, optimal beamforming at the UAV and power allocation at the base station (BS), in order to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the severe non-convexity of the problem, we decouple the problem into three sub-problems and solve them sequentially. First, the optimal location of the UAV is determined by minimizing the total path loss. Next, the UAV beamforming is solved by transforming the problem into second-order cone programming (SOCP) and finally the power allocation at the BS is determined using linear-fractional programming (LFP). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs better than the baseline schemes and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3477084.3484953", "Authors": ["Noor Waqar", "Syed Ali Hassan", "Aamir Mahmood", "Mikael Gidlund", "Haejoon Jung"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450387019", "nombredePage": "34  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["NUST", "NUST", "Mid-Sweden University, Sweden", "Mid Sweden University", "Kyung Hee University"], "Conference": "6G-ABS '21: Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technologies for Smart Cities with 6G", "doi": "10.1145/3477084", "Total_Citations": "0"},

{"title": "Barracuda: The Power of \u2113-polling in Proof-of-Stake Blockchains", "date": "02 July 2019", "abstract": "A blockchain is a database of sequential events that is maintained by a distributed group of nodes. A key consensus problem in blockchains is that of determining the next block (data element) in the sequence. Many blockchains address this by electing a new node to propose each new block. The new block is (typically) appended to the tip of the proposer's local blockchain, and subsequently broadcast to the rest of the network. Without network delay (or adversarial behavior), this procedure would give a perfect chain, since each proposer would have the same view of the blockchain. A major challenge in practice is forking. Due to network delays, a proposer may not yet have the most recent block, and may therefore create a side chain that branches from the middle of the main chain. Forking reduces throughput, since only one a single main chain can survive, and all other blocks are discarded. We propose a new P2P protocol for blockchains called Barracuda, in which each proposer, prior to proposing a block, polls \u2113 other nodes for their local blocktree information. Under a stochastic network model, we prove that this lightweight primitive improves throughput as if the entire network were a factor of \u2113 faster. We provide guidelines on how to implement Barracuda in practice, guaranteeing robustness against several real-world factors.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3323679.3326533", "Authors": ["Giulia Fanti", "Jiantao Jiao", "Ashok Makkuva", "Sewoong Oh", "Ranvir Rana", "Pramod Viswanath"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450367646", "nombredePage": "419  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Carnegie-Mellon University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], "Conference": "Mobihoc '19: Proceedings of the Twentieth ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing", "doi": "10.1145/3323679", "Total_Citations": "9"},

{"title": "A Novel Framework of Vehicle Ad-Hoc Networks based on Virtualization and Distributed Ledger Technology", "date": "25 November 2019", "abstract": "Recent advances of routing algorithms have greatly improved the reliability and efficiency of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). But the constraints of network resources result in a trade-off between reliable data transmission and the performance of routing protocols. Rather than relaying data via intensive routing procedures, the distributed technology can spread data source over multiple cooperative components to facilitate the data access. Particularly, decentralized ledger technology (DLT), which is in essence a distributed technology, incorporates all the participants to maintain and synchronize the full copy of data. Coupled with the consensus mechanism, it guarantees the preservation of trustworthy data. These two key features of DLT contribute a more reliable data delivery. However, in VANETs, due to the locomotion of vehicles, the participants of DLT frequently adjust their physical connection, and thus interrupt their data transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, where the VANET is built upon the virtualization of DLT (vDLT), to achieve seamless and reliable data transmission. In the proposed framework, components in VANETs are equipped to run vDLT nodes, which disseminate data in the virtualization layer; thus, the variation of physical layout is transparent to the data transmission via vDLT. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3345838.3356003", "Authors": ["Zhaowei Ma", "Li Zhu", "Richard Yu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450369077", "nombredePage": "119  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada", "Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China", "Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"], "Conference": "DIVANet '19: Proceedings of the 9th ACM Symposium on Design and Analysis of Intelligent Vehicular Networks and Applications", "doi": "10.1145/3345838", "Total_Citations": "3"},

However, current work on testing smart contract only focus on static problems of smart contract programs. A data flow oriented test case generation approach for dynamic testing of smart contract programs is still missing. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel test case generation approach, called ADF-GA (All-uses Data Flow criterion based test case generation using Genetic Algorithm), for Solidity based Ethereum smart contract programs. ADF-GA aims to efficiently generate a valid set of test cases via three stages. First, the corresponding program control flow graph is constructed from the source codes. Second, the generated control flow graph is analyzed to obtain the variable information in the Solidity programs, locate the require statements, and also get the definition-use pairs to be tested. Finally, a genetic algorithm is used to generate test cases, in which an improved fitness function is proposed to calculate the definition-use pairs coverage of each test case with program instrumentation. Experimental studies are performed on several representative Solidity programs. The results show that ADF-GA can effectively generate test cases, achieve better coverage, and reduce the number of iterations in genetic algorithm.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3387940.3391499", "Authors": ["Pengcheng Zhang", "Jianan Yu", "Shunhui Ji"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450379632", "nombredePage": "831  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Hohai University, Jiangning Qu, Nanjing Shi, China", "Hohai University, Jiangning Qu, Nanjing Shi, China", "Hohai University, Jiangning Qu, Nanjing Shi, China"], "Conference": "ICSEW'20: Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops", "doi": "10.1145/3387940", "Total_Citations": "5"},

In cryptographic self-selection, each round r has a seed Qr. In round r, each account owner is asked to digitally sign Qr, hash their digital signature to produce a credential, and then broadcast this credential to the entire network. A publicly-known function scores each credential in a manner so that the distribution of the lowest scoring credential is identical to the distribution of stake owned by each account. The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring credential is the leader for round r, and their credential becomes the seed Qr+1. Such protocols leave open the possibility of manipulation: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring credentials in round r can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in order to influence the seed for round r+1. Indeed, the user can pre-compute their credentials for round r+1 for each potential seed, and broadcast only the credential (among those with low enough score to be leader) that produces the most favorable seed.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3490486.3538337", "Authors": ["Matheus V.X.

The results from Study 3 (N=99) furthermore reveal that Bitcoin is perceived significantly better in fulfilling all three functions than Ethereum or Ripple.

They are denied formal support because of the lack of a legally recognized identity. For this type of humanitarian support, contemporary identities can offer a way out. Self-sovereign identities (SSI) can provide individuals ownership over their data and the ability to share this with others. The essence is that the owner determines whom they share their identity data with. They have the sole ownership of the identity data. As such, an SSI ensures privacy for undocumented persons. This would allow to provide support to those who are left behind by a lack of formal identity. In this article, we explore the possibility of SSI to assist undocumented individuals throughout the pandemic times.

{"title": "Power Adjusting and Bribery Racing: Novel Mining Attacks in the Bitcoin System", "date": "06 November 2019", "abstract": "Mining attacks allow attackers to gain an unfair share of the mining reward by deviating from the honest mining strategy in the Bitcoin system. Among the most well-known are block withholding (BWH), fork after withholding (FAW), and selfish mining. In this paper, we propose two new strategies: power adjusting and bribery racing, and introduce two novel mining attacks, Power Adjusting Withholding (PAW) and Bribery Selfish Mining (BSM) adopting the new strategies. Both attacks can increase the reward of attackers. Furthermore, we show PAW can avoid the \"miner's dilemma\" in BWH attacks. BSM introduces a new \"venal miner's dilemma\", which results in all targets (bribes) willing to help the attacker but getting less reward finally. Quantitative analyses and simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our attacks. We propose some countermeasures to mitigate the new attacks, but a practical and efficient solution remains to be an open problem.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3354203", "Authors": ["Shang Gao", "Zecheng Li", "Zhe Peng", "Bin Xiao"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450367479", "nombredePage": "2755  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong", "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"], "Conference": "CCS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3319535", "Total_Citations": "28"},
{"title": "Mechanisms for outsourcing computation via a decentralized market", "date": "15 July 2020", "abstract": "As the number of personal computing and IoT devices grows rapidly, so does the amount of computational power that is available at the edge. Many of these devices are often idle and constitute an untapped resource which could be used for outsourcing computation. Existing solutions for harnessing this power, such as volunteer computing (e.g., BOINC), are centralized platforms in which a single organization or company can control participation and pricing. By contrast, an open market of computational resources, where resource owners and resource users trade directly with each other, could lead to greater participation and more competitive pricing. To provide an open market, we introduce MODiCuM, a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants from misbehaving---which is a key problem in decentralized systems---by resolving disputes via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since it does not require global trust in mediation results. We provide analytical results proving that MODiCuM can deter misbehavior, and we evaluate the overhead of MODiCuM using experimental results based on an implementation of our platform.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3401025.3401737", "Authors": ["Scott Eisele", "Taha Eghtesad", "Nicholas Troutman", "Aron Laszka", "Abhishek Dubey"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450380287", "nombredePage": "244  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Vanderbilt University", "University of Houston", "University of Houston", "University of Houston", "Vanderbilt University"], "Conference": "DEBS '20: Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3401025", "Total_Citations": "2"},

To address this, we present SmartBugs, an extensible and easy-to-use execution framework that simplifies the execution of analysis tools on smart contracts written in Solidity, the primary language used in Ethereum. SmartBugs is currently distributed with support for 10 tools and two datasets of Solidity contracts. The first dataset can be used to evaluate the precision of analysis tools, as it contains 143 annotated vulnerable contracts with 208 tagged vulnerabilities. The second dataset contains 47,518 unique contracts collected through Etherscan. We discuss how SmartBugs supported the largest experimental setup to date both in the number of tools and in execution time.

While charging their EVs, users expose their identity and personal details, and an adversary being able to identify and track where users charge their EVs is a potential privacy threat. In this article, we propose a user-empowered privacy-preserving authentication protocol for EV charging based on Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) to provide Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-security. The proposed method gives users full control over their identities and allows them to remain anonymous while charging from any station. Giving control over their identities empowers users. At the same time, by making use of the concept of VC, other parties can verify that a user is legitimate and authenticate the user before providing charging services.

Uniswap, as the most prominent cryptocurrency decentralized exchange (DEX), is continuing to attract scammers, with fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take the first step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first investigate the landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives based on its transactions. Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap. We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on Uniswap, which suggests that roughly 50% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam tokens are created specialized for the \"rug pull\" scams, and some scam tokens have embedded tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts. We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help carry out the scams. The scammers have gained a profit of at least $16 million from 39,762 potential victims.

With their flexible-yet-scalable design and robustness against intrusion, we are observing a rapid increase in their popularity as a backbone of real-world permission-less payment settlement networks (e.g., Ripple and Stellar) as well as several other weak-identity systems requiring Sybil-tolerant communication. In payment scenarios, due to their unique capability to unite emerging crypto-currencies and user-defined currencies with the traditional fiat currency and banking systems, several existing and new payment enterprises are entering in this space. Nevertheless, this enthusiasm in the market significantly exceeds our understanding of security, privacy, and reliability of these inherently distributed systems. Currently employed ad hoc strategies to fix apparent flaws have made those systems vulnerable to bigger problems once they become lucrative targets for malicious players.

{"title": "Safe and Private Forward-trading Platform for Transactive Microgrids", "date": "30 December 2020", "abstract": "Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3403711", "Authors": ["Scott Eisele", "Taha Eghtesad", "Keegan Campanelli", "Prakhar Agrawal", "Aron Laszka", "Abhishek Dubey"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "2378-962X", "nombredePage": "266  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Vanderbilt University", "0000-0003-2496-8916", "University of Houston", "Vanderbilt University", "Vanderbilt University", "University of Houston", "0000-0001-7400-2357", "Vanderbilt University"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems", "doi": "2378-9638", "Total_Citations": "2"},

Traditional GNNs, however, are not able to capture higher-order topological information, and their performance is known to degrade with the presence of negative edges that may arise in many common financial applications. Considering the rich semantic inference of negative edges, excluding them as an obvious solution is not elegant. Alternatively, another basic approach is to apply positive normalization, however, this also may lead to information loss. Our work proposes a simple yet effective solution to overcome these two challenges by employing the eigenvectors with top-k largest eigenvalues of the raw adjacency matrix for pre-embeddings. These pre-embeddings contain high-order topological knowledge together with the information on negative edges, which are then fed into a GNN with a positively normalized adjacency matrix to compensate for its shortcomings.

It is an effective managerial instrument that helps to coordinate and enhance all spheres of life in a megalopolis. The role of digital technology is preconditioned by its wide spread and the fact that it has turned into one of the essential factors of growth and competitiveness. The paper is aimed at discussing the main areas of development of digital technology, its possible applications in the concept of a smart city and finding out how this technology can affect the quality of life of the population. The process of transition to smart cities is especially relevant. The population density in megalopolises and the speed of the processes taking place in them create conditions for increased social tension. In this way, digital technology is responsible for a whole set of special functions. St. Petersburg implements the concept of a smart city within the 2035 Socioeconomic Development Strategy of the City, whose purpose is to ensure a stable improvement in the quality of life of the population through sustainable economic growth. The growth can be achieved if the results of innovative and technological activities are used and the global competitiveness of St. Petersburg is raised. The 2035 Strategy provides for the accelerated development of the knowledge economy, which creates the basis for accelerated economic growth. The paper considers the possibility of monitoring the quality of life of the population on the basis of a sociological survey in which citizens are interviewed about the public and municipal services provided to them in St. Petersburg. The results of the survey show that, in general, the quality of the public service \u201cRenewal of the national passport upon reaching the age of 20\u201d is rated as great or good by 43.6% of respondents, as satisfactory by 39.6%, and as poor and very bad by 12.6% of people. The remaining 3.9% were undecided. The concept of a smart city is the one St. Petersburg should strive for implementing in its economy, as the global problems of the impact on the urban environment are becoming increasingly worrying for the residents of the city. The information interaction between the population and local self-government needs to be developed and transformed. In particular, a single Internet portal should be created for the municipalities of St. Petersburg. This project will help to save a lot of money, which can further be used for developing new inter-municipal projects.

However, the existing two-party protocols of ECDSA are not optimal: either their online phase requires decryption of a ciphertext, or their offline phase needs at least two executions of multiplicative-to-additive conversion which dominates the overall complexity. This paper proposes an online-friendly two-party ECDSA with a lightweight online phase and a single multiplicative-to-additive function in the offline phase. It is constructed by a novel design of a re-sharing of the secret key and a linear sharing of the nonce. Our scheme significantly improves previous protocols based on either oblivious transfer or homomorphic encryption. We implement our scheme and show that it outperforms prior online-friendly schemes (i.e., those have lightweight online cost) by a factor of roughly 2 to 9 in both communication and computation. Furthermore, our two-party scheme could be easily extended to the 2-out-of-n threshold ECDSA.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484803", "Authors": ["Haiyang Xue", "Man Ho Au", "Xiang Xie", "Tsz Hon Yuen", "Handong Cui"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450384544", "nombredePage": "3558  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences & The University of Hong Kong, Beijing, China", "The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China", "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Privacy-Preserving Computation, Shanghai, China", "The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China", "The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"], "Conference": "CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3460120", "Total_Citations": "0"},

Past efforts such as the Cross Fault Tolerance (XFT) model address this problem by making a weaker assumption that a majority of nodes are correct and communicate synchronously. Although XPaxos of Liu et al. (applying the XFT model) achieves similar performance as Paxos, it does not scale with the number of faults. Also, its reliance on a single leader introduces considerable downtime in case of failures. We present Elpis, the first multi-leader XFT consensus protocol. By adopting the Generalized Consensus specification, we were able to devise a multi-leader protocol that exploits the commutativity property inherent in the commands ordered by the system. Elpis maps accessed objects to non-faulty replicas during periods of synchrony. Subsequently, these replicas order all commands which access these objects.

{"title": "Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation for Computationally-Secure Randomness, Consensus, and Threshold Signatures.", "date": "02 November 2020", "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation (ADKG) algorithm which is also the first distributed key generation algorithm that can generate cryptographic keys with a dual (f,2f+1)-threshold (where f is the number of faulty parties). As a result, using our ADKG we remove the trusted setup assumption that the most scalable consensus algorithms make. In order to create a DKG with a dual (f,2f+1)- threshold we first answer in the affirmative the open question posed by Cachin et al. [7] on how to create an Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing (AVSS) protocol with a reconstruction threshold of f+1<k \u0142e 2f+1, which is of independent interest. Our High-threshold-AVSS (HAVSS) uses an asymmetric bivariate polynomial to encode the secret. This enables the reconstruction of the secret only if a set of k nodes contribute while allowing an honest node that did not participate in the sharing phase to recover his share with the help of f+1 honest parties. Once we have HAVSS we can use it to bootstrap scalable partially synchronous consensus protocols, but the question on how to get a DKG in asynchrony remains as we need a way to produce common randomness. The solution comes from a novelEventually Perfect Common Coin (EPCC) abstraction that enables the generation of a common coin from n concurrent HAVSS invocations. EPCC's key property is that it is eventually reliable, as it might fail to agree at most f times (even if invoked a polynomial number of times). UsingEPCC we implement anEventually Efficient Asynchronous Binary Agreement (EEABA) which is optimal when the EPCC agrees and protects safety when EPCC fails. Finally, using EEABA we construct the first ADKG which has the same overhead and expected runtime as the best partially-synchronous DKG (O(n4) words, O(f) rounds). As a corollary of our ADKG, we can also create the first Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement (VABA) that does not need a trusted dealer to setup threshold signatures of degree n-f. Our VABA has an overhead of expected O(n2) words and O(1) time per instance, after an initial O(n4) words and O(f) time bootstrap via ADKG.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3372297.3423364", "Authors": ["Eleftherios Kokoris Kogias", "Dahlia Malkhi", "Alexander Spiegelman"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450370899", "nombredePage": "2180  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Facebook Novi & IST Austria, London, United Kingdom", "Facebook Novi, Menlo Park, CA, USA", "Facebook Novi, Menlo Park, CA, USA"], "Conference": "CCS '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3372297", "Total_Citations": "10"},

Because current cryptocurrencies require that all transactions are processed and stored on a distributed ledger -- the so-called blockchain -- transaction throughput is inherently limited.

Examples of off-chain protocols include payment channels and networks, which are currently deployed by popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A further extension of payment networks envisioned for cryptocurrencies are so-called state channel networks. In contrast to payment networks that only support off-chain payments between users, state channel networks allow execution of arbitrary complex smart contracts. The main contribution of this work is to give the first full specification for general state channel networks.

Such graphs can then be published with the help of any standard mechanisms using triplestores or as linked data objects accessible via standard web mechanisms using the HTTP protocol to make them available on the web.

{"title": "PhishLedger: A Decentralized Phishing Data Sharing Mechanism", "date": "07 July 2019", "abstract": "In recent years, phishing has become one of the biggest security threats on the Internet. To combat phishing, it requires multiple steps and multi-agency participation and thus desperately need uniform data sharing format and unobstructed sharing channels, which unfortunately is just what is lacking currently. This paper proposes a novel phishing data sharing mechanism based on the consortium blockchain. It designs four types of nodes, including reporting node, accounting node, servicing node and supervising node and illustrates the roles of each type. Then it demonstrates the process of reporting, accounting and servicing and designs the process of post-supervision, which ensures the operation of the mechanism stable and fastest; and then discusses its implementation on Hyperledger Fabric. The proposed mechanism includes multi-source reporting, anti-tamper accounting, multi-channel disposal of phishing data and post-supervision. It provides a platform for multi-party participation, transparent and efficient coordination and unified standard and overcomes the current prominent problems of phishing data sharing; and the participants on the consortium blockchain all have a strong desire to combat phishing, which ensures the proposed mechanism is also very practical and highly feasible.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3343147.3343154", "Authors": ["Dongjie Liu", "Wei Wang", "Yang Wang", "Yaling Tan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450371773", "nombredePage": "163  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, Beijing, China", "Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China", "Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China", "Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"], "Conference": "IECC '19: Proceedings of the 1st International Electronics Communication Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3343147", "Total_Citations": "3"},

From the perspective of enterprises, progressive punishment can be set to increase the cost of fraud, improve the remuneration system and use the reward reporting function of blockchain technology to reduce the motivation of fraud; from the perspective of auditors, the mandatory rotation system can be implemented to increase the cost of non-compliance, enhance the independence of auditors and use the reward mechanism of blockchain audit to reduce the probability of collusion.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3452446.3452542", "Authors": ["Shali Liu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450389815", "nombredePage": "1143  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Shandong University"], "Conference": "IPEC2021: 2021 2nd Asia-Pacific Conference on Image Processing, Electronics and Computers", "doi": "10.1145/3452446", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "A Chaincode-based Framework for Securing Patient Health Information in Hospital Environment", "date": "28 March 2022", "abstract": "Goal of any healthcare system is to provide good service to the public in a most effective manner. The hospital healthcare system is a common platform for people to access the health related services, anytime and anywhere. This service is completely driven by the regulations and policies of government and hospital administration. At present most hospital systems in India lack a secure mechanism for maintaining and managing patient health records. This is a crucial capability which a hospital healthcare system must have. Failure to have a robust system will cause multiple issues like inaccessibility when required, wrongfully sharing patient health record or allowing unethical players to access the health records. This will ultimately lead to lack of trust in the system Most of the current hospital healthcare systems store information centrally and provide access to the connected nodes as required. This architecture leads to single point of failure when central server is down or crashes or gets hacked. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a Chaincode-based framework to secure patient health information in hospital environment. Chaincode is a smart contract program which gets executed on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network automatically. A Chaincode stores the information in decentralized digital ledger and creates a secured and private blockchain network with trusted nodes and provide data visibility, data security, and data transparency with respect to patient health record at any time. This technology could solve the above said problem in more efficient way and provide better visibility and transparency to patient health data with more security.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3512676.3512681", "Authors": ["Anitha Premkumar", "Shanmugarathinam"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387422", "nombredePage": "219  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["CSE, Presidency University, India", "CSE, Presidency University, India"], "Conference": "ICCMB 2022: 2022 5th International Conference on Computers in Management and Business (ICCMB)", "doi": "10.1145/3512676", "Total_Citations": "0"},
{"title": "An empirical investigation on the trade-off between smart contract readability and gas consumption", "date": "20 October 2022", "abstract": "Blockchain technology is becoming increasingly popular, and smart contracts (i.e., programs that run on top of the blockchain) represent a crucial element of this technology. In particular, smart contracts running on Ethereum (i.e., one of the most popular blockchain platforms) are often developed with Solidity, and their deployment and execution consume gas (i.e., a fee compensating the computing resources required). Smart contract development frequently involves code reuse, but poor readable smart contracts could hinder their reuse. However, writing readable smart contracts is challenging, since practices for improving the readability could also be in contrast with optimization strategies for reducing gas consumption. This paper aims at better understanding (i) the readability aspects for which traditional software and smart contracts differ, and (ii) the specific smart contract readability features exhibiting significant relationships with gas consumption. We leverage a set of metrics that previous research has proven correlated with code readability. In particular, we first compare the values of these metrics obtained for both Solidity smart contracts and traditional software systems (written in Java). Then, we investigate the correlations occurring between these metrics and gas consumption and between each pair of metrics. The results of our study highlight that smart contracts usually exhibit lower readability than traditional software for what concerns the number of parentheses, inline comments, and blank lines used. In addition, we found some readability metrics (such as the average length of identifiers and the average number of keywords) that significantly correlate with gas consumption.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3524610.3529157", "Authors": ["Anna Vacca", "Michele Fredella", "Andrea Di Sorbo", "Corrado A.

{"title": "FairSwap: How To Fairly Exchange Digital Goods", "date": "15 October 2018", "abstract": "We introduce FairSwap -- an efficient protocol for fair exchange of digital goods using smart contracts. A fair exchange protocol allows a sender S to sell a digital commodity x for a fixed price p to a receiver R. The protocol is said to be secure if R only pays if he receives the correct x. Our solution guarantees fairness by relying on smart contracts executed over decentralized cryptocurrencies, where the contract takes the role of an external judge that completes the exchange in case of disagreement. While in the past there have been several proposals for building fair exchange protocols over cryptocurrencies, our solution has two distinctive features that makes it particular attractive when users deal with large commodities.

{"title": "Wavoice: A Noise-resistant Multi-modal Speech Recognition System Fusing mmWave and Audio Signals", "date": "15 November 2021", "abstract": "With the advance in automatic speech recognition, voice user interface has gained popularity recently. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, VUI is increasingly preferred in online communication due to its non-contact. Additionally, various ambient noise impedes the public applications of voice user interfaces due to the requirement of audio-only speech recognition methods for a high signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we present Wavoice, the first noise-resistant multi-modal speech recognition system that fuses two distinct voice sensing modalities, i.e., millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals and audio signals from a microphone, together. One key contribution is that we model the inherent correlation between mmWave and audio signals. Based on it, Wavoice facilitates the real-time noise-resistant voice activity detection and user targeting from multiple speakers. Furthermore, we elaborate on two novel modules into the neural attention mechanism for multi-modal signals fusion, and result in accurate speech recognition. Extensive experiments verify Wavoice's effectiveness under various conditions with the character recognition error rate below 1% in a range of 7 meters. Wavoice outperforms existing audio-only speech recognition methods with lower character error rate and word error rate. The evaluation in complex scenes validates the robustness of Wavoice.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3485730.3485945", "Authors": ["Tiantian Liu", "Ming Gao", "Feng Lin", "Chao Wang", "Zhongjie Ba", "Jinsong Han", "Wenyao Xu", "Kui Ren"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450390972", "nombredePage": "686  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China and Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Cyberspace Governance of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China", "University at Buffalo, the State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, USA", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"], "Conference": "SenSys '21: Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3485730", "Total_Citations": "3"},
{"title": "Anonymity and Privacy in Bitcoin Escrow Trades", "date": "11 November 2019", "abstract": "As a decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been in market for around a decade. Bitcoin transactions are thought to be pseudo-anonymous, however, there were many attempts to deanonymize these transactions making use of public data. Escrow services have been introduced as a good private and secure way to handle Bitcoin payments between untrusted parties, where the escrow service acts as the arbitrator in case of disputes. In our work, we examine the privacy and anonymity level of trades done through one of the Bitcoin trading websites offering such escrow services and how using the data they provide for open access through their APIs along with some public scraped data can compromise the privacy and anonymity of trades in some cases. In this paper, we suggest some heuristics and methods to deanonymize Bitcoin escrow trades done on LocalBitcoins.com, a well-known escrow service used especially by people seeking anonymity, and link them to suspect sets of Bitcoin transactions in the blockchain and suspect sets of users. Our research spots privacy weakness points of using escrow services that affects the privacy and anonymity of their users trades and identities. It also shows how tracking down criminals activities across escrow services is possible even without any authority on the escrow service making it less attractive for criminals to use cryptocurrencies and leading it to gain more trust.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3338498.3358639", "Authors": ["Farida Sabry", "Wadha Labda", "Aiman Erbad", "Husam Al Jawaheri", "Qutaibah Malluhi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450368308", "nombredePage": "228  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Qatar University, Doha, Qatar", "Qatar University, Doha, Qatar", "Qatar University, Doha, Qatar", "Qatar University, Doha, Qatar", "Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"], "Conference": "WPES'19: Proceedings of the 18th ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society", "doi": "10.1145/3338498", "Total_Citations": "7"},

In addition to the 'usual' attacks -- a subset of the validators trying to prevent agreement -- there is now the possibility of financial fraud, which can abuse properties not normally considered critical in consensus protocols. We investigate the issues of attackers manipulating or exploiting the order in which transactions are scheduled in the blockchain. More concretely, we look into order fairness, i.e., ways we can assure that the order of transactions relative to each other is fair. We show that one of the more intuitive definitions of fairness is impossible to achieve. We then present Wendy, a group of low overhead protocols that can implement different concepts of fairness. Wendy acts as an additional widget for an existing blockchain, and is largely agnostic to the underlying blockchain and its security assumptions, as long as they provide a known and always active set of validators.

However, a growing number of scenarios require the system service to act as a Binder client and to send queries to a Binder server possibly instantiated by the application. Departing from this role-reversal possibility, this paper proposes the Binder Transaction Redirection (BiTRe) attacks, where the attacker induces the system service to transact with a customized Binder server and then attacks from the Binder server---an often unprotected direction. We demonstrate the scale of the attack surface by enumerating the utilizable Binder interfaces in BiTRe, and discover that the attack surface grows with the Android release version. In Android 11, more than 70% of the Binder interfaces are affected by or can be utilized in BiTRe. We prove the attacks' feasibility by (1) constructing a prototype system that can automatically generate executable programs to reach a substantial part of the attack surface, and (2) identifying a series of vulnerabilities, which are acknowledged by Google and assigned ten CVEs.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484801", "Authors": ["Xiaobo Xiang", "Ren Zhang", "Hanxiang Wen", "Xiaorui Gong", "Baoxu Liu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450384544", "nombredePage": "3558  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Alpha Lab; and 360 Government & Enterprise Security Group, Beijing, China", "Nervos & Shandong Institute of Blockchain, Beijing, China", "Ant Group, Hanzhou, China", "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China", "Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"], "Conference": "CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3460120", "Total_Citations": "0"},

With cloud-edge computing, the computing tasks in IoV is able to be delivered to the edge servers (ESs) instead of the cloud and rely on the deployed services of ESs for a series of processing. Due to the storage and computing resource limits of ESs, how to dynamically deploy partial services to the edge is still a puzzle. Moreover, the decision of service deployment often requires the transmission of local service requests from ESs to the cloud, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, a method for privacy-aware IoV service deployment with federated learning in cloud-edge computing, named PSDF, is proposed. Technically, federated learning secures the distributed training of deployment decision network on each ES by the exchange and aggregation of model weights, avoiding the original data transmission. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is adopted for the uploaded weights before the model aggregation on the cloud. Besides, a service deployment scheme based on deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed. Eventually, the performance of PSDF is evaluated by massive experiments.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3501810", "Authors": ["Xiaolong Xu", "Wentao Liu", "Yulan Zhang", "Xuyun Zhang", "Wanchun Dou", "Lianyong Qi", "Md Zakirul Alam Bhuiyan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Refereed"], "ISBN": "2157-6904", "nombredePage": "424  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, Weifang Key Laboratory of Blockchain on Agricultural Vegetables, WeiFang University of Science and Technology, Shouguang, China, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, and Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Soochow, China", "School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China", "Weifang Key Laboratory of Blockchain on Agricultural Vegetables, WeiFang University of Science and Technology, Shouguang, China", "Department of Computing, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia", "State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China", "School of Information Science and Engineering, Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China", "Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Fordham University, New York, USA"], "Conference": "ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology", "doi": "2157-6912", "Total_Citations": "1"},

Towards long-term blockchain scalability, both of these must be pruned. While a large body of literature has explored the pruning of application data (UTXOs, account balances, and contract state), little has been said about the permanent pruning of consensus data (block headers). We present a protocol which allows pruning the blockchain by garbage collecting old blocks as they become unnecessary. These blocks can simply be discarded and are no longer stored by any miner. We show that all miners can be light miners with no harm to security. Our protocol is based on the notion of superblocks, blocks that have achieved an unusually high difficulty. We leverage them to represent underlying proof-of-work without ever illustrating it, storing it, or transmitting it. After our pruning is applied, the storage and communication requirements for consensus data are reduced exponentially. We develop new probabilistic mathematical methods to analyze our protocol in the random oracle model. We prove our protocol is both secure and succinct under an uninterrupted honest majority assumption for 1/3 adversaries. Our protocol is the first to achieve always secure, always succinct, and online Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, all necessary components for a logarithmic space mining scheme.

{"title": "The Gap Game", "date": "15 October 2018", "abstract": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized consensus protocol by incentives. The protocol participants, called miners, generate (mine) a series of blocks, each containing monetary transactions created by system users. As incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted currency and transaction fees paid by transaction creators. Blockchain bandwidth limits lead users to pay increasing fees in order to prioritize their transactions. However, most prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a notable exception, Carlsten et al. [17] postulated that if incentives come only from fees then a mining gap would form~--- miners would avoid mining when the available fees are insufficient. In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings, taking into account all elements of expenses and rewards. To study when gaps form, we analyze the system as a game we call the gap game. We analyze the game with a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a wide range of scenarios. Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.'s postulate; indeed, we show that gaps form well before fees are the only incentive, and analyze the implications on security. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different gap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operating costs are identical. Alarmingly, we see that the system incentivizes large miner coalitions, reducing system decentralization.

To answer these questions, we embark on an axiomatic theory of incentives in proof-of-work blockchains at the time scale of a single block.

{"title": "Proof-of-Stake Mining Games with Perfect Randomness", "date": "18 July 2021", "abstract": "Proof-of-Stake blockchains based on a longest-chain consensus protocol are an attractive energy-friendly alternative to the Proof-of-Work paradigm. However, formal barriers to \"getting the incentives right\" were recently discovered, driven by the desire to use the blockchain itself as a source of pseudorandomness. We consider instead a longest-chain Proof-of-Stake protocol with perfect, trusted, external randomness (e.g. a randomness beacon). We produce two main results. First, we show that a strategic miner can strictly outperform an honest miner with just 32.8% of the total stake. Note that a miner of this size cannot outperform an honest miner in the Proof-of-Work model. This establishes that even with access to a perfect randomness beacon, incentives in Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake longest-chain protocols are fundamentally different. Second, we prove that a strategic miner cannot outperform an honest miner with 30.8% of the total stake. This means that, while not quite as secure as the Proof-of-Work regime, desirable incentive properties of Proof-of-Work longest-chain protocols can be approximately recovered via Proof-of-Stake with a perfect randomness beacon. The space of possible strategies in a Proof-of-Stake mining game is significantly richer than in a Proof-of-Work game. Our main technical contribution is a characterization of potentially optimal strategies for a strategic miner, and in particular a proof that the corresponding infinite-state MDP admits an optimal strategy that is positive recurrent.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3465456.3467636", "Authors": ["Matheus V.

{"title": "Scientific Workflows in IoT Environments: A Data Placement Strategy Based on Heterogeneous Edge-Cloud Computing", "date": "10 August 2022", "abstract": "In Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) environments, the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing paradigm can provide a more proper solution to deploy scientific workflows compared to cloud computing or other traditional distributed computing. Owing to the different sizes of scientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it is essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data transmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge computing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the dynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and exiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To address this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model that includes shared datasets within the individual and among multiple workflows across various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement strategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the build-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to proper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution problem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning\u2013based approach to learn the data placement strategy in the runtime stage of scientific workflows. Through using the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing architecture to simulate IoT environments, we designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of DYM-RL-DPS. The results of our strategy can effectively reduce the data transmission time as compared to other strategies.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3531327", "Authors": ["Xin Du", "Songtao Tang", "Zhihui Lu", "Keke Gai", "Jie Wu", "Patrick C.

Specifically, we first design a linear programming model to intelligently guide the GPU/PIM task scheduling. An extended finite-state-machine model is designed for the GPU memory controller to switch PIM working mode (compute/memory mode) accordingly. Finally, considering the speed difference between intra-/inter-channel memory accesses, a hybrid memory access method is proposed to minimize inter-channel data movements. We evaluate Co-Mining based on Samsung's HBM2-based function-in-memory architecture.

The proposed mechanism comprises two primary smart contract-based modules, namely the reputation module and the reverse auction module. The former is used to dynamically calculate the reputation score of each FL participant. It employs a trust-jointed reputation scheme to balance the weights between trust values of parameters and bid prices. The latter is responsible for initiating FL auction tasks, calculating price rankings, and assigning corresponding token rewards. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed mechanism against the three typical threats.

This omnipresence of volunteering led to a plethora of volunteer management systems (VMS), mainly supporting NPOs in scheduling and allocating tasks to volunteers. In contrast to this NPO-centric approach of existing VMS, we focus on volunteers by investigating the following core question: \"How can the engagement of volunteers be digitized and exploited in a life-long way\". To provide a first step towards answering this question, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, an in-depth study of related approaches is provided identifying shortcomings but also promising concepts. Second, challenges which have to be tackled to deal with the broad spectrum and peculiarities of volunteering are identified and a vision for a next-generation VMS called iVolunteer is pointed out.

{"title": "Uncovering Smart Contract VM Bugs Via Differential Fuzzing", "date": "27 January 2022", "abstract": " The ongoing public interest in blockchains and smart contracts has brought a rise to a magnitude of different blockchain implementations. The rate at which new concepts are envisioned and implemented makes it hard to vet their impact on security. Especially smart contract platforms, executing untrusted code, are very complex by design. Still, people put their trust and money into chains that may lack proper testing. A behavior deviation for edge cases of single op-codes is a critical bug class in this brave new world. It can be abused for Denial of Service against the blockchain, chain splits, double-spending, or direct attacks on applications operating on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose an automated methodology to uncover such differences. Through coverage-guided and state-guided fuzzing, we explore smart contract virtual machine behavior against multiple VMs in parallel. We develop NeoDiff, the first framework for feedback-guided differential fuzzing of smart contract VMs. We discuss real, monetary consequences our tool prevents. NeoDiff can be ported to new smart contract platforms with ease. Apart from fuzzing Ethereum VMs, NeoDiff found a range of critical differentials in VMs for the Neo blockchain. Moreover, through a higher-layer semantics mutator, we uncovered semantic discrepancies between Neo smart contracts written in Python when executed on the blockchain vs. classic CPython.

However, we observe that in practice, many applications on permissioned blockchains do not benefit from the decentralized architecture. When decentralized architecture is used but not required, system performance is often restricted, resulting in low throughput, high latency, and significant storage overhead. Hence, we propose LedgerDB on Alibaba Cloud, which is a centralized ledger database with tamper-evidence and non-repudiation features similar to blockchain, and provides strong auditability. LedgerDB has much higher throughput compared to blockchains. It offers stronger auditability by adopting a TSA two-way peg protocol, which prevents malicious behaviors from both users and service providers. LedgerDB supports verifiable data removals demanded by many real-world applications, which are able to remove obsolete records for storage saving and hide records for regulatory purpose, without compromising its verifiability. Experimental evaluation shows that LedgerDB's throughput is 80X higher than state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric).

Although this trait permits concealing in the plain sight, the public ledger of Bitcoin blockchain provides more power for investigators and allows collective intelligence for anti-money laundering and forensic analysis. This fascinating paradox arises in the strength of Bitcoin technology. Machine learning techniques have attained promising results in forensic analysis, in order to spot suspicious behaviour in Bitcoin blockchain. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of classical supervised learning methods using a recently published data set derived from Bitcoin blockchain, to predict licit and illicit transactions in the network. Besides, an ensemble learning method is utilised using a combination of the given supervised learning models, which outperforms the given classical methods. This experiment is performed using a newly published data set derived from Bitcoin blockchain. Our main contribution points out that using ensemble learning approach outperforms the performance of the classical learning models used in the original paper, using Elliptic data set, a time series of Bitcoin transaction graph with node transactions and directed payments flow edges. Using the same data set, we show that we are able to predict licit/illicit transactions with an accuracy of 98.13% and F1 score equals to 83.36% using the proposed method.

Towards that, first we construct the Bitcoin ideal functionality to formally specify its ideal execution model in a synchronous network.

To leverage DLs at scale, their well-known limitation (i.e., performance) should be adequately analyzed and addressed. Directed acyclic graph-based DLs have been proposed to tackle the performance and scalability issues by design. The first among them, IOTA, has shown promising signs in addressing the preceding issues. IOTA is an open source DL designed for the Internet of Things. It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, to achieve a potentially higher scalability over blockchain-based DLs. However, due to the uncertainty and centralization of the deployed consensus, the current IOTA implementation exposes some performance issues, making it less performant than the initial design. In this article, we first extend an existing simulator to support realistic IOTA simulations and investigate the impact of different design parameters on IOTA\u2019s performance. Then, we propose a layered model to help the users of IOTA determine the optimal waiting time to resend the previously submitted but not yet confirmed transaction. Our findings reveal the impact of the transaction arrival rate, tip selection algorithms, weighted tip selection algorithm randomness, and network delay on the throughput. Using the proposed layered model, we shed some light on the distribution of the confirmed transactions. The distribution is leveraged to calculate the optimal time for resending an unconfirmed transaction to the DL.

{"title": "\u00c6GIS: Shielding Vulnerable Smart Contracts Against Attacks", "date": "05 October 2020", "abstract": "In recent years, smart contracts have suffered major exploits, cost- ing millions of dollars. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain. As such, they cannot be modified once deployed. Though various tools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority fails to protect vulnera- ble contracts that have already been deployed on the blockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the issue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision and are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack. In this work, we introduce \u00c6GIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects smart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of detecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack patterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is tailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language enables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing attack patterns.

Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts cannot be updated once deployed. Though various tools were proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, they all fail to protect contracts that have already been deployed on the blockchain.

In this work, we introduce \u00c6 GIS, a tool that shields smart contracts and users on the blockchain from being exploited. To this end, \u00c6GIS reverts transactions in real-time based on pattern matching. These patterns encode the detection of malicious transactions that trigger exploits or scams.

They allow a group of distrustful parties to optimistically execute an application-defined program amongst themselves, while the blockchain serves as a backstop in case of a dispute or abort. This effectively bypasses the congestion, fees and performance constraints of the underlying blockchain in the typical case. However, state channels introduce a new and undesirable assumption that a party must remain online and synchronised with the blockchain at all times to defend against execution fork attacks. An execution fork can revert a state channel's history, potentially causing financial damage to a party that is innocent except for having crashed. To provide security even to parties that may go offline for an extended period of time, we present Pisa, the first protocol to propose an accountable third party who can be hired by parties to cancel execution forks on their behalf.

Bitcoin uses a peer-to-peer network without a third trusted party but still maintained trust in the network. The consensus mechanisms do the task of trust-building by executing certain algorithms to bring consensus to the peer nodes of the network. The consensus mechanism used in bitcoin is Proof of Work which involves a massive computation of hashes to validate a block and add it to the blockchain. As the applicability of blockchain increased, the computation-heavy consensus mechanisms were not suitable for real-time transactions. And so, there is a need for a new efficient and high throughput consensus mechanism. This paper proposes a new consensus mechanism using a scope index to mine a new block. This consensus mechanism deals with forking conditions, and the presence of malicious nodes in the network is also studied and compared with other consensus mechanisms.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3508072.3508226", "Authors": ["Avinash Kshirsagar", "Vinod Pachghare"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387347", "nombredePage": "847  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Computer Engineering Department, College of Engineering Pune, India", "Computer Engineering Department, College of Engineering Pune, India"], "Conference": "ICFNDS 2021: The 5th International Conference on Future Networks & Distributed Systems", "doi": "10.1145/3508072", "Total_Citations": "0"},

In order to better facilitate the government to strengthen food safety supervision and protect people's food safety, it is necessary for the government to realize information interaction with enterprises related to the food supply chain and ensure the traceability of food flowing into the market by exchanging and sharing the data of food safety information. With the rapid promotion and popularization of various mobile terminals in the Internet era, the data analysis technology based on artificial intelligence technology is more accurate, which makes the value contained in the data more and more important to people. At present, many fields need the opening and sharing of big data, but there is no reliable data sharing environment in the field of food supervision, and it is still difficult to ensure the traceability of data related to food safety. Blockchain has unique advantages of decentralization and distribution, which can help break the current obstacles of big data sharing and exchange and achieve a high degree of data sharing, interconnection and exchange. Based on the blockchain technology, this paper studies the food safety data sharing and exchange mechanism, combines the blockchain with the distributed file system, constructs the data connection model, stores the shared information on the blockchain, then introduces IPFs and zigzag coding, designs the corresponding control method, and establishes a reliable data sharing and exchange mechanism. The analysis shows that the data sharing and exchange mechanism proposed in this paper can meet the needs of food safety data sharing and exchange.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3523181.3523193", "Authors": ["Jie Yu", "Danning Li", "Kai Chen", "Wei Huang", "Meiyuan Qin", "Xianjin Qin"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450387453", "nombredePage": "202  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Guizhou Academy of Testing and Analysis, China and Guizhou Academy of Sciences Big Data Co.LTD, China", "Guizhou Academy of Testing and Analysis, China and Guizhou Academy of Sciences Big Data Co.LTD, China", "Guizhou Academy of Testing and Analysis, China and Guizhou Academy of Sciences Big Data Co.LTD, China", "Guizhou Academy of Sciences Big Data Co.LTD, China", "Guizhou Academy of Sciences Big Data Co.LTD, China", "Guizhou Academy of Sciences Big Data Co.LTD, China"], "Conference": "ASSE' 22: 2022 3rd Asia Service Sciences and Software Engineering Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3523181", "Total_Citations": "0"},

In traditional distributed systems, network partitions are generally a result of bugs or connectivity failures; the typical goal of the system designer is to automatically recover from such issues as seamlessly as possible. Blockchain-based systems, however, rely on purposeful \"forks\" to roll out protocol changes in a decentralized manner. Not all users may agree with proposed changes, and thus forks can persist, leading to permanent network partitions. In this paper, we closely study the large-scale fork that occurred in Ethereum, a new blockchain technology that allows for both currency transactions and smart contracts. Ethereum is currently the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $28B. We explore the consequences of this fork, showing the impact on the two networks and their mining pools, and how the fork lead to unintentional incentives and security vulnerabilities.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3152434.3152449", "Authors": ["Lucianna Kiffer", "Dave Levin", "Alan Mislove"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article", "Research", "Refereed limited"], "ISBN": "9781450355698", "nombredePage": "206  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Northeastern University", "University of Maryland", "Northeastern University"], "Conference": "HotNets-XVI: Proceedings of the 16th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks", "doi": "10.1145/3152434", "Total_Citations": "19"},

A Novel Smart Contracts-based Music Recommendation System", "date": "27 November 2021", "abstract": "The current streaming music ecosystem provides a mature and prevalent platform for artists to publish music products and for listeners to consume music services. However, as the main power of streaming content producers, artists have little to no control over their musical works after assigning their copyrights and management to third parties, especially for long-tail artists. The booming development of blockchain technology in recent years brings a fresh change to the music industry. The clear copyrights recorded on-chain attract more and more artists to stand in line, although blockchain-based music platforms are still in their early stage of development. As the number of users and artists keeps increasing, some platforms continue to use the recommendation design of the current streaming music ecosystem. The shortage in this system could cause a long-tail phenomenon again. In this work, we proposed a novel music recommendation system by considering the value of three parties on the platform. Through designing two scheme-based recommendations by leveraging the flexible agreement design of smart contracts, we proposed an effective music promotion strategy for the blockchain-based music platform.

It takes the content as the center for data transmission, and uses the data itself to name, which completely changes the original network transmission system. Blockchain is a distributed platform in peer-to-peer network environment, in which multiple nodes participate and reach a consensus through a specific consistency algorithm. It has the characteristics of unforgeability, tamper proof and traceability, and carries trusted data and computing services. Alliance chain is a kind of blockchain, the characteristics of the alliance's blockchain, such as decentralization, non tampering, traceability, access mechanism, and information disclosure within the network, point out the direction for the realization of a new domain name system of co management and co governance.This paper gives full play to the trustworthiness and non tampering characteristics of blockchain technology, integrates the naming and addressing scheme based on alliance chain into Name Data Network(NDN) architecture, and proposes an open system of independent naming and marking and exchanging data content index in peer-to-peer network environment.

A major open question is whether cryptocurrencies are fundamentally able to support as much traffic as traditional, centralized solutions. One prominent approach for improving the scalability of blockchains is payment channel networks (PCNs) [1]. Instead of committing every transaction to the blockchain, a separate overlay network (called a PCN) is maintained. Each node represents a user, and each edge (or payment channel) represents pre-allocated funds that can be efficiently transacted between the two endpoints under a mutual agreement. Users can transact with each other by relaying payments over a sequence of channels.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3410048.3410095", "Authors": ["Weizhao Tang", "Weina Wang", "Giulia Fanti", "Sewoong Oh"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "0163-5999", "nombredePage": "110  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "University of Washington, WA, USA"], "Conference": "ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review", "doi": "10.1145/3410048", "Total_Citations": "0"},

One important reason for a lack of decentralized trust models for access control has been difficulties in referring to and accessing cryptographic key material in a decentralized fashion.

To solve this problem, we propose repurposing the access control scheme SDSI (Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure).

{"title": "eThor: Practical and Provably Sound Static Analysis of Ethereum Smart Contracts", "date": "02 November 2020", "abstract": "Ethereum has emerged as the most popular smart contract platform, with hundreds of thousands of contracts stored on the blockchain and covering diverse application scenarios, such as auctions, trading platforms, or elections. Given the financial nature of smart contracts, security vulnerabilities may lead to catastrophic consequences and, even worse, can hardly be fixed as data stored on the blockchain, including the smart contract code itself, are immutable. An automated security analysis of these contracts is thus of utmost interest, but at the same time technically challenging. This is as e.g., Ethereum's transaction-oriented programming mechanisms feature a subtle semantics, and since the blockchain data at execution time, including the code of callers and callees, are not statically known. In this work, we present eThor, the first sound and automated static analyzer for EVM bytecode, which is based on an abstraction of the EVM bytecode semantics based on Horn clauses. In particular, our static analysis supports reachability properties, which we show to be sufficient for capturing interesting security properties for smart contracts (e.g., single-entrancy) as well as contract-specific functional properties. Our analysis is proven sound against a complete semantics of EVM bytecode, and a large-scale experimental evaluation on real-world contracts demonstrates that eThor is practical and outperforms the state-of-the-art static analyzers: specifically, eThor is the only one to provide soundness guarantees, terminates on 94% of a representative set of real-world contracts, and achieves an F-measure (which combines sensitivity and specificity) of 89%.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3372297.3417250", "Authors": ["Clara Schneidewind", "Ilya Grishchenko", "Markus Scherer", "Matteo Maffei"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450370899", "nombredePage": "2180  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria", "TU Wien, Vienna, Austria", "TU Wien, Vienna, Austria", "TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"], "Conference": "CCS '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security", "doi": "10.1145/3372297", "Total_Citations": "27"},

{"title": "SADPonzi: Detecting and Characterizing Ponzi Schemes in Ethereum Smart Contracts", "date": "04 June 2021", "abstract": "Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes, i.e., either based on the operation codes (opcodes) of the smart contract binaries or the transaction patterns of addresses. However, state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability and high false positive rates. Moreover, machine-learning based methods are susceptible to evasion techniques, and transaction-based techniques do not work on smart contracts that have a small number of transactions. These limitations render existing methods for detecting Ponzi schemes ineffective. In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, by strictly following the definition of Ponzi schemes, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to first generate the semantic information for each feasible path in smart contracts and then identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims.

It offers responsive feedback, captures many property violations, and its default settings are calibrated based on experimental data. To date, Echidna has been used in more than 10 large paid security audits, and feedback from those audits has driven the features and user experience of Echidna, both in terms of practical usability (e.g., smart contract frameworks like Truffle and Embark) and test generation strategies. Echidna aims to be good at finding real bugs in smart contracts, with minimal user effort and maximal speed.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3395363.3404366", "Authors": ["Gustavo Grieco", "Will Song", "Artur Cygan", "Josselin Feist", "Alex Groce"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["short-paper"], "ISBN": "9781450380089", "nombredePage": "591  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["Trail of Bits, USA", "Trail of Bits, USA", "Trail of Bits, USA", "Trail of Bits, USA", "Northern Arizona University, USA"], "Conference": "ISSTA 2020: Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis", "doi": "10.1145/3395363", "Total_Citations": "30"},

The empirical analysis shows that residents' risk perception and sense of belonging are significantly affected by three supervisory stimuli: health certification, behavioral civilization points and subjective norm.

{"title": "On The Unforkability of Monero", "date": "02 July 2019", "abstract": "Monero, ranked as one of the top privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies by market cap, introduced semi-annual hard fork in 2018. Although hard fork is not an uncommon event in the cryptocurrency industry, the two hard forks in 2018 caused an anonymity risk to Monero where transactions became traceable due to the problem of key reuse. Thisproblem was triggered by the existence of multiple copies of the same coin on different Monero blockchain branches such that the users spent the coins multiple times without preemptive action. We investigate the Monero hard fork events by analysing the transaction data on three different branches of the Monero blockchain. Although we have discovered an insignificant portion of traceable inputs compared to the total available inputs in our dataset, our analyses show that the scalability of the event depends on external factors such as market price and market availability. We propose a cheap, easy to implement strategy to prevent the problem of key reuse, should in the future stronger Monero forks emerge in the market.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3321705.3329823", "Authors": ["Dimaz Ankaa Wijaya", "Joseph K.

Since 2020, DeFi has started to develop in the cryptocurrency markets. Then, with the increase in popularity of digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and with the launch of the Metaverse, DeFi has been introduced into the Social environment by the combination of social networking and finance in the blockchain. This new shape of DeFi has been called Social Finance (SocialFi). SocialFi can be seen as the social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing to get monetary benefits from being part of SocialFi platforms. In detail, SocialFi has a special feature that is decentralized, open and user-controlled, and it started to be adopted by the communities. The main component of SocialFi is the Social token used to reward people.

{"title": "How are solidity smart contracts tested in open source projects?: an exploratory study", "date": "19 July 2022", "abstract": "Smart contracts are self-executing programs that are stored on the blockchain. Once a smart contract is compiled and deployed on the blockchain, it cannot be modified. Therefore, having a bug-free smart contract is vital. To ensure a bug-free smart contract, it must be tested thoroughly. However, little is known about how developers test smart contracts in practice. Our study explores 139 open source smart contract projects that are written in Solidity to investigate the state of smart contract testing from three dimensions: (1) the developers working on the tests, (2) the used testing frameworks and testnets and (3) the type of tests that are conducted. We found that mostly core developers of a project are responsible for testing the contracts. Second, developers typically use only functional testing frameworks to test a smart contract, with Truffle being the most popular one. Finally, our results show that functional testing is conducted in most of the studied projects (93%), security testing is only performed in a few projects (9.4%) and traditional performance testing is conducted in none.

{"title": "CoinParty: Secure Multi-Party Mixing of Bitcoins", "date": "02 March 2015", "abstract": "Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses anonymous cryptographic identities to achieve financial privacy. However, Bitcoin's promise of anonymity is broken as recent work shows how Bitcoin's blockchain exposes users to reidentification and linking attacks. In consequence, different mixing services have emerged which promise to randomly mix a user's Bitcoins with other users' coins to provide anonymity based on the unlinkability of the mixing. However, proposed approaches suffer either from weak security guarantees and single points of failure, or small anonymity sets and missing deniability. In this paper, we propose CoinParty a novel, decentralized mixing service for Bitcoin based on a combination of decryption mixnets with threshold signatures. CoinParty is secure against malicious adversaries and the evaluation of our prototype shows that it scales easily to a large number of participants in real-world network settings. By the application of threshold signatures to Bitcoin mixing, CoinParty achieves anonymity by orders of magnitude higher than related work as we quantify by analyzing transactions in the actual Bitcoin blockchain and is first among related approaches to provide plausible deniability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2699026.2699100", "Authors": ["Jan Henrik Ziegeldorf", "Fred Grossmann", "Martin Henze", "Nicolas Inden", "Klaus Wehrle"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "publisherAddress": "New York, NY, United States", "Qualifiers": ["research-article"], "ISBN": "9781450331913", "nombredePage": "362  pages", "AuthorsFormation": ["RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany", "RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany", "RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany", "RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany", "RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"], "Conference": "CODASPY '15: Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy", "doi": "10.1145/2699026", "Total_Citations": "71"}
