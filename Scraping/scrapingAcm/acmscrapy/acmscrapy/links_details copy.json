{"title": "BSS-ITS: Blockchain Scaling Scheme with Sharding for Intelligent Transportation System: Scale Blockchain for Better Data Exchange and Storage with Full Sharding for Intelligent Transportation System", "date": "25 February 2022", "abstract": "With the development of modern technologies, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has made great progress and brought convenience to every aspect of people's lives. ITS has become more complicated and uncertain due to the existing security and privacy problems. Blockchain, being a decentralized and tamper-resistant technology, can provide an environment for ITS, allowing ITS entities to perform transactions securely and trustfully. However, the inefficiency problem of blockchain, severely restricts its development and application. Studies only combine traditional blockchain with ITS, but do not consider scaling blockchain to improve performance. This paper devotes to scale blockchain that adapted to ITS, improving the efficiency of the blockchain without sacrificing the decentralization and security. A sharding scheme is proposed, which takes network sharding, data sharding and state sharding into account. Nodes are divided into several shards. Different shards can process data in parallel and store related data in their own ledger. Backup shard is put forward in this paper to enhance the shard security. And network will reshuffle when one or more shards break down. Some experiments are performed using Hyperledger Fabric and network simulator 3. Throghput, storage and delay are tested under sharding scheme and non sharding solution. The results show that sharding method is effective in scaling blockchain for ITS.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3510487.3510506", "Authors": ["Yufei Liu", "Jiqiang Liu", "Jian Wang", "Tianhao Liu", "Xudong He"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450387460", "nombredePage": "183  pages"},

{"title": "A Blockchain Communication Resource Optimization Consensus Method", "date": "29 October 2022", "abstract": "Since the emergence of Bitcoin, the blockchain technology behind it has been gradually gaining attention from all walks of life. As the core of blockchain technology, the consensus algorithm determines the security, scalability and decentralization of the blockchain and many other important characteristics. The efficiency of the current blockchain consensus algorithm still needs to be improved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a consensus algorithm for communication resource optimization (CCRO), which divides consensus nodes into different domains, calculates the trust of nodes by several trust factors, and assigns different roles to nodes according to the trust. It also introduces a new class of nodes, i.e., communication nodes, which are responsible for the delivery of messages in the consensus process, and achieves the communication resource optimization of the blockchain system. By building an experimental platform, we verify the performance of CCRO, which downscales the inter-node consensus communication protocol, optimizes the regional data synchronization protocol, reduces the network communication overhead, and effectively improves the consensus efficiency.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3559795.3559810", "Authors": ["Jingchang Yu", "Tao Shen", "Fenhua Bai", "Zhuo Yu", "Jianzhao Luo"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450396622", "nombredePage": "143  pages"},

We first provide a brief introduction of the blockchain technology, highlighting its design principle, nuts and bolts, and the most fundamental innovation of the technology. Next, we elaborate on a key concept regarding data immutability. In particular, it is a mistake to equate blockchain to data immutability. Data immutability can only be achieved in large-scale public blockchains where the cost becomes an insurmountable barrier for any attempt to change the data recorded in the blockchain. The third topic we discuss is the differences between public, private, and consortium blockchains. We caution the use of private and consortium blockchains. The last topic we argue is regarding blockchain consensus.

Blockchain technology, with the characteristics of asymmetric encryption, decentralization, nonrepudiation, and conducting transactions without the supervision of a trusted third party, has revolved multiple stages of development. Smart contracts are regarded as an important derivative technology of blockchain, which are automatically executed by the code between multiple parties through the blockchain without relying on a trusted institution. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based supply chain financial system combining smart contracts and main methods of supply chain financing to solve the disadvantages of SCF. We select three represented financing modes to design financing platforms with the introduction of smart contracts, and present our schemes in the form of specific pseudo code. All financing processes of supply chain are conducted on the basis of ethereum blockchain. This allows SMEs which have difficulty in capital turnover in the short term, or have insufficient credit to get financial loans more easily compared with traditional financing approaches due to merits of blockchain, and also this could facilitate supply chain to improve financing efficiency for SMEs.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3510487.3510497", "Authors": ["Xiaocong Yu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450387460", "nombredePage": "183  pages"},

In a robotics environment, the old information is useful for human evaluation, or to perform analysis, but it is not useful for robots that require only current information to continue their work. This causes a storage problem in Blockchain nodes as in the case of nodes attached to robots that are usually built around embedded solutions. This paper presents a time-segmentation solution for devices with limited storage capacity, integrated into a particular robot-directed Blockchain called RobotChain.

In recent years, the logistics cloud platform, as a new model of Internet + logistics development, can integrate all the information of service supply chain providers and realize the digitization and networking of logistics resources. However, limited by the existing technology and management mechanism, the development of my country's logistics cloud platform is still in its infancy, and the phenomenon of uneven distribution of power and information asymmetry is expected, which limits the willingness of enterprises to share information to a certain extent. It is also not conducive to the long-term development of the logistics cloud platform.

Thus, most blockchain technologies assume an environment with a fast and stable network. However, in some blockchain-based systems, e.g., supply chain management (SCM) systems, some Internet of Things (IoT) nodes can only rely on the low-quality network sometimes to achieve consensus. Thus, it is critical to understand the applicability of existing consensus algorithms in such environments. We performed a systematic mapping study to evaluate and compare existing consensus mechanisms\u2019 capability to provide integrity and security with varying network properties. Our study identified 25 state-of-the-art consensus algorithms from published and preprint literature. We categorized and compared the consensus algorithms qualitatively based on established performance and integrity metrics and well-known blockchain security issues. Results show that consensus algorithms that rely on synchronous network for correctness cannot provide the expected integrity. Such consensus algorithms may also be vulnerable to distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) and routing attacks, given limited network throughput.

{"title": "Blockchain Adoption for Plea Bargaining of Corporate Crime in Indonesia", "date": "29 May 2020", "abstract": "The rise of corporate crime cases now shows that the handling has not found the right model, even though so far there has been a concept of legal settlement outside the court, otherwise known as plea bargaining. In addition to those who support, there are criticisms of the use of plea bargaining (such as too much discretion of prosecutors in plea bargaining, lack of legal substance that limits the possibility of abuse of authority by law enforcement officials, and the possibility of guilty plea not yet actual), but this criticism can be refuted through the use of blockchain technology in the mechanism of plea bargaining. In Indonesia, the regulation of the bargaining of corporate crime plea is still limited to the draft law. In fact, the draft is still not in accordance with the spirit of plea bargaining itself, such as the defendant whose plea bargaining application was received must still be tried through a short event examination, it does not regulate which types of criminal acts are categorized as special lines, bidding restrictions or negotiations between the defendant and the claimant general, and what form of waivers or rewards or concessions can be offered by public prosecutors. This shows the importance and urgency to build a transparent, efficient, fast and inexpensive plea bargaining model in Indonesia through the use of blockchain technology. In addition, the use of blockchain technology can provide adequate outputs and outcomes in dealing with corporate crime, because any data, information, complaints, and reports that are inputted based on each block will be automatically integrated into the fairness, legal certainty, and public benefit values as an independent and accountable decisionmaking tool for the authorities.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3390566.3391680", "Authors": ["Henry Dianto P.

A supply chain performance framework was developed in order to measure the supply chain performance from both lean and agile aspects. The results show a significant correlation in performance with the degree of visibility, but it is not a linear relationship. An effective LeAgile supply chain can be achieved with the enhancement of visibility. In order to implement visibility, an appropriate information sharing frequency (drumbeat) is needed. Blockchain allows users to more securely and transparently track all types of transactions, to improve Supply Chain Visibility. We also find the complex relationship between trust and visibility.

{"title": "Occupation mechanism for eliminating double-spending attacks on trusted transaction blockchain", "date": "20 July 2021", "abstract": "Using blockchain technology to build a trusted transaction foundation has become a hot topic of current research and practice. The double-spending phenomenon refers to the bifurcation of the blockchain structure. In the process of trusted transactions, the fork caused by malicious attacks will destroy the correctness, integrity, and consistency of the entire ledger, and causes serious economic losses to users. Therefore, eliminating double-spending attacks is an important issue to ensure the security of the blockchain. The current method of defending against double-spending attacks in trusted transactions mainly revolves around the Bitcoin blockchain system. In the process of researching the Nano blockchain grid project, a high-throughput trusted transaction system, we proposed a double-spending elimination solution for the system: the occupying mechanism.

To sustain such business model, the establishment of a data service platform for IoT data sharing and data service delivery becomes a necessity. Today, blockchain-based platforms are believed to be reliable but have poor system performance, considerable storage overheads and high energy consumption. MEC technology is then applied to help IoT devices participate in the blockchain network. However, the considerable loading of blockchain operations turns MEC hosts into a performance bottleneck, instead. Therefore, this paper exploits the hierarchical blockchain architecture in the proposed IoT data service platform, called HB-IoDS, to significantly reduce the storage overheads and service providing time. Furthermore, to alleviate the heavy burdens on MEC hosts, HB-IoDS provides the adaptive Proof-of-Work (APoW) consensus algorithm that derives an appropriate difficulty to achieve PoW condition according to device capability. By this mean, resource-constrained IoT devices can also perform blockchain operations which are usually regarded as energy-consuming. Finally, simulation results show that HB-IoDS outperforms existing blockchain-based platforms in terms of system performance, energy consumption, and storage costs. As a result, the proposed HB-IoDS is the most practical IoT data service platform.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3390566.3391674", "Authors": ["I-Hsun Chuang", "Shau-Hsien Chiang", "Wei-Chu Chao", "Shih-Hao Huang", "Bai-Lin Zeng", "Yau-Hwang Kuo"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450377676", "nombredePage": "166  pages"},

{"title": "A Blockchain Based Land Registration and Ownership Management System for Bangladesh", "date": "25 February 2022", "abstract": "From the times of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoins invention in 2008 Blockchain has become one of the most popular technologies to keep records secure, immutable, transparent and in distributed ledger. Blockchain is the underlining technology of Bitcoin. Blockchain technology has been used in many domains such as IoT, healthcare, education, business, Land management and so on. Among them Land Registration and Ownership Management is a very tough process all over the world. Land is a state immovable object and many frauds claim false ownership. It creates disputes among people. Also, many intermediaries are involved in this system. These intermediaries take huge amount of money to solve problems in time. For this reason, many people fail to achieve their own land. Blockchain technology has the all characteristics to solve these problems. It keeps data transparent, immutable and secure, at the same time it does not need any intermediaries. For the powerful characteristics of blockchain technology, the authors of this paper proposed a permissioned blockchain-Hyperledger based solution model to solve the problems of land registration and ownership management system. Here the authors present a system overview of the proposed system, a flowchart of working flow and an architecture.

{"title": "On PeerCoin Proof of Stake for Blockchain Consensus", "date": "20 July 2021", "abstract": "Proof of Stake (PoS) has been talked about extensively as an alternative way of reaching consensus in blockchain systems. However, there are few publications on how PoS can be used to create new blocks in detail. The undisputed lead proponent for PoS is Ethereum. However, virtually all discussions regarding PoS for Ethereum are centered on selecting a block using PoS after one or more candidate blocks have already been somehow created. PeerCoin was the first blockchain system that incorporated PoS in block creation. Unfortunately, there is no known documentation on how PoS works in PeerCoin. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a detailed explanation of the PeerCoin PoS algorithm based on PeerCoin source code. We also dispel the misconception that PeerCoin PoS is based on Proof of Work (PoW) and hence would consume a lot of energy just like proof of work (PoW). In fact, it resembles PoW only on surface and differs from PoW substantially in terms of how to meet the difficulty target.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460547", "Authors": ["Wenbing Zhao", "Shunkun Yang", "Xiong Luo", "Jiong Zhou"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450389624", "nombredePage": "216  pages"},

However, there still exist different scalability, security and potential privacy issues in blockchain networks, such as on-chain data privacy, data origin authentication, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving and user-controlled architecture for data sharing based on blockchain system and Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), called ThemisABE. The proposed scheme has properties including one-to-many data encrypting and fined-grained access control. In the ThemisABE, any party can be an authority and the algorithm of CP-ABE generates the secret key corresponding to attributes for data user through any chosen set of nodes in blockchain system. Moreover, in order to realize accountability of CP-ABE algorithm and avoid performance bottleneck incurred by smart contracts, a kind of data structure of transactions is designed to record in the ledger, following an approaches to off-chain computations. The results of security analysis and experimental simulation show that the proposed scheme can solves the problems of privacy security and localization of data sharing. At the same time, the data sharing scheme has better performance and could be applied in some scenarios, such as eHealth, eGovernment or cross-border paperless trade.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460559", "Authors": ["Xiaodong Zhang", "Taowei Chen", "Yan Feng", "Yimin Yu"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450389624", "nombredePage": "216  pages"},

To scale up the blockchain services, a common approach is to employ a hybrid storage architecture, where only meta-data are stored on-chain and the raw data are outsourced to an off-chain storage service provider. In this scenario, users need to query the data on-chain and off-chain at the same time, and the key issue for query processing would be how to design a gas-efficient authenticated data structure (ADS) to guarantee the completeness and soundness. In this paper, we study the spatial keyword authentication queries in the hybrid-storage blockchain, which includes on-chain and off-chain storage.

However, in the network with poor synchronization, the traditional PoS produces multiple verified representative nodes in each round, which generates multiple blocks. Then the blockchain is easy to produce the bifurcation. Aiming at the bifurcation problem of PoS, we propose an improved voting method based on credit rewards and punishments to vote on multiple blocks. The block is selected by considering the credibility of the creator, the count of the obtained comprehensive votes and the transaction value of the block.

{"title": "Practical Application and Evaluation of Atomic Swaps for Blockchain-based Recommender Systems", "date": "21 March 2021", "abstract": "Recommender Systems are very popular tools within the online community, suggesting to their users a big variety of items like products, videos, music and locations to visit. Moreover, users actively populate these systems sending and reading opinions under the form of reviews, and potentially obtaining a reward for their activities. However, such systems typically rely on a central authority that acts as a trusted party having total control over the system. Decentralized Recommender Systems have been proposed to solve such issue distributing the control and responsibility on the hands of their users, but leading to risks in case of disputes or misbehaviour. Based on a general architecture of a Decentralized Recommender System, in this paper we identify the potential unfair exchanges that may rise during the activity between two users, and we propose a solution based on the concept of atomic swaps inherited from the blockchain technology. Finally, we provide an attack model to show that the proposed solution creates fair processes.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3446983.3446993", "Authors": ["Andrea Lisi", "Andrea De Salve", "Paolo Mori", "Laura Ricci"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450388962", "nombredePage": "80  pages"},

At present, the registration of digital copyright of images should be authorized by authoritative management agencies. There are many problems, such as long audit cycle, no substantive review, difficulty in proof, high cost, centralized storage and so on. Based on blockchain technology and SIFT local feature extraction algorithm, this paper studies and implements a new generation of image digital copyright system. SIFT algorithm is used to extract the invariant features of image such as angle of view, brightness and rotation, etc. which will constitute the local feature vector set of the image, and these local feature vector sets are regarded as the only copyright basis of the image. Even if the image is modified by scaling, rotation and brightness, local features can still be extracted correctly, which can effectively prevent copyright registration of infringing images; Furthermore, IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) was utilized for distributed storage of images' copyright features; Finally, Hyperledger Fabric and smart contract (chaincode) are used to realize copyright registration, copyright transfer and other functions.

When a client has discovered an SP to have violated a service level agreement based on cryptographic proof, then they can obtain cryptocurrency as a compensation by raising objections to a smart contract on a public blockchain. When an objection has been judged successful by programs located in the smart contract, a portion of the deposit (cryptocurrency in the smart contract) will be transferred to the account of the objection-raiser. In this way, the need to establish and run a customer service center with employees for processing such claims and refunds is obviated.

Due to the characteristics of geographical dispersion, randomness, volatility and uncontrollability of renewable energy, the centralized traditional electrical energy networks cannot meet the management requirements of large-scale access to renewable energy. The emergence of the energy internet has enabled the effective use of renewable energy. As a distributed trading and data management technology, blockchain solves the problem of distributed electrical energy trading in the energy Internet. However, the distributed energy trading based on blockchain cannot satisfy the rational matching of trading objects. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based electrical energy trading system BC-TMS Blockchain-based trading matching system, which can reasonably match trading objects according to the user's personalized needs and maximize the benefits of both parties to the trading.

Blockchains have caught not only the attention of researchers but also industries that are interested in implementing blockchains into existing products and services. However, performing studies on actual blockchain networks remain challenging as they may involve many nodes or these nodes could be placed in different geographical regions. Simulators for Proof-of-Work blockchain exists to facilitate this, but features such as difficulty adjustment or dynamic hash rate are not available. Using SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator as a base, difficulty adjustment algorithm and the capacity to increase or decrease hash rate dynamically were added to the simulator and the efficacy of the implementation was investigated for two scenarios; fixed hash rate and increasing hash rate periodically, over the length of the simulations. Based on the experiments, higher precision in terms of the average of actual time taken to mine a block were obtained, with a deviation of 0.68% compared to 5.73% in original SimBlock, and a deviation of 7.10% compared to 10.91% in original SimBlock, for fixed hash rate and dynamic hash rate adjustment respectively.

This progress requires a novel data sharing and computation mechanism among different parties as a foundation of society governance. In this paper, we introduce a new typical society governance pattern that has been emerging in the most modern cities in the world. With the involvement of smart decision-making units that change the interaction among objects in the governing process, we name the new pattern as \u201cdouble-loop governing\u201d. And to meet the higher requirement of data security and privacy protection in the process of new society governing way, we proposed a multi-party data computation and sharing scheme based on blockchain which can guarantee that every participator in the process of society governance can efficiently conduct computation based on diverse resources of data while the ownership of data can be ensured.

{"title": "Unraveling Blockchain based Crypto-currency System Supporting Oblivious Transactions: a Formalized Approach", "date": "02 April 2017", "abstract": "User privacy is an important issue in a blockchain based transaction system. Bitcoin, being one of the most widely used blockchain based transaction system, fails to provide enough protection on users' privacy. Many subsequent studies focus on establishing a system that hides the linkage between the identities (pseudonyms) of users and the transactions they carry out in order to provide a high level of anonymity. Examples include Zerocoin, Zerocash and so on. It thus becomes an interesting question whether such new transaction systems do provide enough protection on users' privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for de-anonymizing these transaction systems by leveraging information in the system that is not directly related, including the number of transactions made by each identity and time stamp of sending and receiving. Combining probability studies with optimization tools, we establish a model which allows us to determine, among all possible ways of linking between transactions and identities, the one that is most likely to be true. Subsequent transaction graph analysis could then be carried out, leading to the de-anonymization of the system. To solve the model, we provide exact algorithms based on mixed integer linear programming. Our research also establishes interesting relationships between the de-anonymization problem and other problems studied in the literature of theoretical computer science, e.g., the graph matching problem and scheduling problem.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3055518.3055528", "Authors": ["Lin Chen", "Lei Xu", "Nolan Shah", "Nour Diallo", "Zhimin Gao", "Yang Lu", "Weidong Shi"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "short-paper", "ISSN": "9781450349741", "nombredePage": "48  pages"},

To manage the data collected and sampled by medical devices, traditional centralized data management will lead to attacks such as single point of failure, which pose a security threat. Aiming at the problems of low data trust and uncontrolled data sharing in telemedicine, we proposed blockchain-based secure medical data management and disease prediction. To securely manage healthcare data, we carefully designed three-tier architecture. Specifically, in the user sensor layer, medical sensors monitor the patient status in real-time. In the storage layer, to protect the privacy of patients, we stored their data in blocks and quantified the medical data by using information entropy technology. In addition, in the blockchain layer, we also used smart contracts for application, authorization, and access control of health data to eliminate privacy leaks caused by internal and external security risks. The information summary is recorded on the blockchain to ensure the integrity of backtracking and anti-repudiation. We designed an extensible machine learning algorithm to predict disease types using a disease prediction model algorithm based on transfer learning. Security analysis and numerical results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively manage the safety data of telemedicine and predict the patient's future condition.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3494106.3528678", "Authors": ["Meiquan Wang", "Huiru Zhang", "Haoyang Wu", "Guangshun Li", "Keke Gai"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450391757", "nombredePage": "153  pages"},

However, as a commercial service, the state-of-the-art payment models for cloud gaming are still in their preliminary stages. In this paper, we reveal the shortages of existing cloud gaming pricing models and propose CloudArcade, a token-based cloud gaming system that employs blockchain-empowered cryptocurrency as a payment method for the players using the cloud gaming services. By using cryptocurrency, CloudArcade provides a transparent and resource-aware pricing method, it also enables a time irrelevant silent payment on the floating price to protects users' payment. These features eliminate the quality of experience degradation caused by the spot price in the traditional dynamic pricing model on the QoE-aware service pricing. We also employ the payment channel in CloudArcade to improve the system performance.

A central database system, which collects and stores data generated from different parties and provides open access, can not only save costs on infrastructures, but also provide consistent and uptodate data for all the participants. However, privacy and security issues also emerge especially when the shared data is highly sensitive, such as electronic medical records (EMRs). In this paper, we propose a new data sharing scheme with access control based on CP-ABE, searchable encryption, and blockchain. We realize two main goals in our scheme. First, data owners can share their data with multiple users who satisfy the access policy rather than just a single user. Second, the difficulty of the ciphertext query is overcome by means of searchable encryption technology. Most importantly, data owners do not need to interact with the data querier in the process of sharing.

As the underlying infrastructure and protocol of blockchain, blockchain networks convey communications and coordination across all involving participants. In extensive application scenarios, conducting community detection over blockchain networks has potential effects on both discovering hidden information and enhancing communicating efficiency. However, the decentralised nature poses a restriction on community detection over blockchain networks. In coping with this restriction, we propose a distributed community detection method based on the Propose-Select-Adjust (PSA) framework that runs in an asynchronous way.

Due to opportunities such as data security, transparency, privacy and interoperability presented by decentralized applications on blockchain networks, organizations are now moving their inter-organizational functions to blockchain-based systems. Traditional system-design methods are not suitable for developing blockchain systems since they are not capable of capturing new functions that are associated with decentralized applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring existing design methods and frameworks that support the development of decentralized application on a blockchain. To achieve this, case-study based research is used in identifying current software-development techniques used in designing decentralized applications (DApp). Experts in this field are interviewed to identify their chosen techniques for designing and developing block-chain applications. Furthermore, related literature is selected to identify current techniques for DApp-designs based on the state of the art.

Building a consortium blockchain for a bidding system is a promising way to benefit the bidding businesses, by reducing cost and sharing data among tenderers and bidders. Generally, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm is the wide-ly-used consensus algorithm in a consortium blockchain. However, this algorithm meets its bottleneck, when there are a large number of nodes in the consortium blockchain net-work. In order to enhance the scalability of the consensus algorithm, this paper puts for-ward an advanced PBFT-based consensus algorithm, named ANPBFT, by taking ad-vantages of the message aggregation technology and tree topology technology. Specially, the consensus nodes in our proposed algorithm are divided into active nodes and passive nodes. Then, the consensus of block information is equivalent to the confirmation of iden-tity aggregation signature and aggregation promise of information key.

The peer-to-peer distributed ledger platform connects organizations and car owners with disparate interests and hidden intentions. While previous literature has chiefly examined incentives for permissionless platforms, we leverage studies about crowdsensing applications to stimulate research on incentives in permissioned blockchains. This article uses the action design research approach to create an incentive system featuring a rating mechanism influenced by data correction measures. Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms.

{"title": "Prediction of the Consolidation Delay in Blockchain-based Applications", "date": "09 April 2021", "abstract": "In the last years, blockchains have become a popular technology to store immutable data validated in a peer-to-peer way. Software systems can take advantage of blockchains to publicly store data (organised in transactions) which is immutable by design. The most important consensus algorithm in public blockchains is the proof-of-work in which miners invest a huge computational power to consolidate new data in a ledger. Miners receive incentives for their work, i.e., a fee decided and paid for each transaction. Rational miners aim to maximise the profit generated by the mining activity, and thus choose the transactions offering the highest fee per byte for their consolidation. In this paper, we propose a queueing model to study the relation between the fee offered by a transaction and its expected consolidation time, i.e., the time required to be added to the blockchain by the miners. The solution of the queueing model, although approximate, is computationally and numerically efficient and software systems can use it online to analyse the trade-off between costs and response times.

Nevertheless, exposure of vehicle-track and traffic transaction information become potential threats that have been ignored by most parking management system. In building intelligent transportation systems, privacy and security issues should be addressed first. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical consortium blockchain TChain and build our practical solutions with parking charges as a typical scenario, which contains on-chain and off-chain ledger interaction model. Specifically, to prevent malicious collection and use of on-chain information, we introduce Pedersen commitment and Token mechanism to anonymize the content of blockchain data and conceal the relationships of transactions. Besides, we analyze and perform a series of vital experiments to verify the effectiveness and security of our proposed solution.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460546", "Authors": ["Zhe Feng", "Lijun Wei", "Yuhan Yang", "Jing Wu", "Chengnian Long"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450389624", "nombredePage": "216  pages"},

However, the current researches of vehicular data sharing and management only focus on a single domain, while fail to adapt to the multi-domain scenarios. Moreover, the issues of privacy preserving and resistance of attacks are also not considered. To this end, we propose a hierarchical data sharing and management system for vehicular ad-hoc networks by combining blockchain and trusted execution environments to achieve transparent data transmission and privacy preserving, wherein the consortium blockchain is regarded as the underlying platform, and the trusted execution environments using Intel SGX is leveraged to guarantee the secure execution of smart contract.

{"title": "Non-Blocking Two Phase Commit Using Blockchain", "date": "15 June 2018", "abstract": "Though the 2 Phase Commit protocol (2PC) remains central to distributed database management, it has a provably-inevitable vulnerability to blocking even when a distributed system guarantees the most demanding synchrony or timing-related requirements. This paper investigates eliminating that vulnerability by coordinating 2PC using a blockchain that supports execution of user-defined smart contracts. It demonstrates that the 2PC blocking can be eliminated at a moderate financial cost, if the blockchain also meets the synchrony requirements. Otherwise, despite the blockchain being a reliable state-machine, eliminating 2PC blocking may well be impossible, depending on whether the cluster hosting the database is synchronous or not. Where not possible, the practical consequences turn out to be not so serious: unnecessary aborts occurring with a small probability.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3211933.3211940", "Authors": ["Paul Ezhilchelvan", "Amjad Aldweesh", "Aad van Moorsel"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450358385", "nombredePage": "121  pages"},

Moreover, we consider both large-size data (e.g., file) and small-size data (e.g., cryptographic hash or key) transfer paradigms, where blockchain and signcryption schemes are seamlessly combined.

{"title": "LBLCO: A Lightweight Blockchain with Low Communication Overhead for Internet of Things", "date": "29 October 2022", "abstract": "With the increasing demand for Internet of things (IOT) applications, more devices need to be added to IOT. IOT system using centralized server mode face great security challenges. Blockchain, based on distributed ledger technology, could be a good solution. In order to combine blockchain technology and IOT applications appropriately, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain with low communication overhead (LBLCO). A new consensus algorithm named proof of repute score based on hidden block (HBPORS) is proposed in LBLCO. The nodes with higher repute score will be more likely to become winner in HBPORS. The repute score mechanism dynamically update the repute score of the nodes according to the contribution and evil behavior of the node in the blockchain system. When the honest node with high repute score obtains the accounting right, it can trigger the hidden block mechanism. Instead of broadcasting the complete information of the packaged block to all nodes, winners can broadcast the low overhead information to other nodes. Through experimental tests, LBLCO can meet the requirements of large number of nodes and fast response speed in the IOT.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3559795.3559808", "Authors": ["Chao Chen", "Mingzhe Liu", "Peijun Mo", "Cuixu Yuan", "Pengyu Dai"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450396622", "nombredePage": "143  pages"},

{"title": "Towards Secure and Scalable Blockchain Technologies", "date": "25 May 2021", "abstract": "The blockchain technology is rapidly gaining grounds as a key technology, especially in the financial and supply chain management sectors. This is largely due to the ability of the technology to (i) efficiently manage the sharing of digital resources between a large number of stakeholders and (ii) to efficiently manage disputes arising in the process. In spite of its many advantages, experience with existing blockchain proposals reveals that there are still many challenges that need to be overcome prior to any large scale industrial adoption, namely [Scalability] Existing permissionless blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin) are able to scale to a considerable number of nodes at the expense of attained throughput (e.g., Bitcoin can only achieve few transactions per second[2]). On the other hand, permission-based blockchains can achieve relatively higher throughput, but can only scale to few hundred nodes. However, one needs to cater for both performance and scalability to meet industrial standards. [Privacy of lightweight clients] Most open blockchain platforms support lightweight clients, targeted for devices like smartphones, that only download and verify a small part of the chain. Here, clients connect to a full node that has access to the complete blockchain and can assist the client in transaction confirmation. As the full node has to learn all transactions issued and received by the requesting client to verify their correctness, such action obviously violates user privacy[1]. In this talk, we plan to overview a number of security challenges pertaining to existing blockchains-effectively capturing almost 8 years of research in this area of work. Moreover, we plan to discuss the performance limitations of existing blockchain-based consensus algorithms and explore different concepts leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enhance the scalability and security of existing consensus algorithms[3]. Finally, we will discuss the privacy provisions of existing lightweight client implementations and explore the solution space to enhance user privacy by leveraging functionality from TEEs[4].", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3457977.3460634", "Authors": ["Ghassan Karame"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "keynote", "ISSN": "9781450384056", "nombredePage": "40  pages"},
{"title": "Preventing Spoliation of Evidence with Blockchain: A Perspective from South Asia", "date": "20 July 2021", "abstract": "Evidence destruction and tempering is a time-tested tactic to protect the powerful perpetrators, criminals, and corrupt officials. Countries where law enforcing institutions and judicial system can be comprised, and evidence destroyed or tampered, ordinary citizens feel disengaged with the investigation or prosecution process, and in some instances, intimidated due to the vulnerability to exposure and retribution. Using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain, as the underpinning technology, here we propose a conceptual model \u2013 \u2018EvidenceChain\u2019, through which citizens can anonymously upload digital evidence, having assurance that the integrity of the evidence will be preserved in an immutable and indestructible manner. Person uploading the evidence can anonymously share it with investigating authorities or openly with public, if coerced by the perpetrators or authorities. Transferring the ownership of evidence from authority to ordinary citizen, and custodianship of evidence from susceptible centralized repository to an immutable and indestructible distributed repository, can cause a paradigm shift of power that not only can minimize spoliation of evidence but human rights abuse too. Here the conceptual model was theoretically tested against some high-profile spoliation of evidence cases from four South Asian developing countries that often rank high in global corruption index and low in human rights index.", "article_link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460550", "Authors": ["Ali Shahaab", "Chaminda Hewage", "Imtiaz Khan"], "Publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "Qualifiers": "research-article", "ISSN": "9781450389624", "nombredePage": "216  pages"}
