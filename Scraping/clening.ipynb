              " 'Abstract': {0: 'Blockchain, originated from Bitcoin system, has drawn intense attention from the academic community because of its decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of fice. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system.',\n",
              "  1: 'Blockchain performance cannot meet the requirement nowadays. One of the crucial ways to improve performance is sharding. However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on the public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, multiple-shard contract calling, strict transaction atomicity, and shard availability, which are essential requirements but also challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving flexible multiple-shard contract calling. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. On a test-bed of 128 AliCloud servers, setting 32 shards and 4 consortium members, Meepo-OpenEtheruem can achieve more than 140,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions. It also shows more than 50,000 TPS under the transactions of real-world shopping behaviors.',\n",
              "  2: 'Diverse technologies, such as machine learning and big data, have been driving the prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous proliferation of IoT devices. Consequently, it is natural that IoT becomes the driving force to meet the increasing demand for frictionless transactions. To secure transactions in IoT, blockchain is widely deployed since it can remove the necessity of a trusted central authority. However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and ficial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target Denial of Service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new committee members auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamirâ€™s secret-sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLBâ€™s resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamotoâ€™s attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms. Extensive evaluation results show the superior resistance against attacks and demonstrate high scalability of BLB compared with current leading paradigms based on PoS and PoW.',\n",
              "  3: 'Blockchain has attracted lots of attention in recent years. However, the performance of blockchain cannot meet the requirement of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the important bottlenecks of blockchain is the limited computing resources on a single server while executing transactions. To address this issue, we propose Aeolus blockchain to achieve the distributed execution of blockchain transactions. There are two key challenges to achieving this for IoT blockchain: transaction structure and state consistency. Facing these challenges, we first propose a distributed blockchain transaction structure, which imports extra parameters to divide the transaction execution into different stages to enable distributed execution. Second, we propose distributed state update sharding, which equips each blockchain peer with its own master and shard servers. In this way, each blockchain peer can be considered as a cluster that distributes the transaction to shorten the processing time and reach the consensus finally. We implement Aeolus on Go-Ethereum to evaluate its feasibility, on a testbed including 132 cloud servers. Our system runs stably for more than 8 h under the workload of 190 000 000 real-world user transactions. Experimental results show the efficiency that Aeolus can achieve more than 100 000 transactions/s of blockchain transactions, which is 15.6 times the throughput of the original blockchain.',\n",

Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including ficial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be â€œThe DAO Attackâ€\\x9d in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversaryâ€™s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.',\n",
              "  5: 'The blockchain-enabled internet of medical things (IoMT) is an emerging paradigm that could provide strong trust establishment and ensure the traceability of data sharing in the IoMT networks. One of the fundamental building blocks for Blockchain is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nevertheless, when processing a large number of transactions, the verification of multiple signatures will incur cumbersome overhead to the nodes in Blockchain. Although batch verification is able to provide a promising approach that verifies multiple signatures simultaneously and efficiently, the upper bound of batch size is limited to small-scale and the efficiency will drop rapidly as the batch size grows in the state-of-the-art ECDSA batch schemes. Meanwhile, most of the existing researches only focus on improving the efficiency of batch verification algorithms in various cryptosystem while ignoring the identification of invalid signatures, which could cause severe performance degradation when the batch verification fails. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an efficient and large-scale batch verification scheme with group testing technology based on ECDSA. The application of the presented protocols in Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric has been analyzed as supportive and effective. When the batch verification returns a false result, we utilize group testing technology to improve the efficiency of identifying invalid signatures. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol outperforms the related ECDSA batch verification schemes.',\n",
              "  6: 'The fast development of Blockchain technology makes it widely applied in several fields of digital transactions, like e-government affairs and the protection of ficial transactions. In this article, we propose a homomorphic encryption-based Blockchain for circuit copyright protection that effectively addresses the issues in the protection of circuit copyright transactions, such as low security of private data, low efficiency in transaction data storage, cooperation and supervision. First, we establish a homomorphic encryption-based mathematical model by utilizing Blockchain and intelligent contract, and next, the algorithms that include Blockchain generation, homomorphic chain encryption/decryption, and intelligent contract are designed. As the intelligent contract is correctly executed in Blockchain, a fully homomorphic encryption-based identity authentication protocol is tackled for Blockchain, given that it ensures the change operation of any third-party in Blockchain and realizes real-time verification. The system is apposite for circuit copyright protection in a blockchain network, due to the use of distributed identity authentication and real-time extensible storage improves the security and extensibility of blockchain-based circuit copyright protection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has reduced the transmission cost and improved the efficiency of data storage and supervision. In addition, it is resilient to several common attacks (e.g., double-spending attacks), yet incurs low cost/overhead and has a higher level of security when compared to three other competing algorithms.',\n",
              "  7: 'Blockchain is an emerging technology, with a decentralized infrastructure avoiding third party dependency. Smartcontracts are one of the features of Ethereum blockchain, capable of running distributed applications in unreliableenvironments, enabling process automation and being one of the most sought technologies due to the highcustomization added to transactions. However, little is known about predicting the cost and execution time behavior of blockchain-based system transactions. This work aims to evaluate the performance of an Ethereum network through an application designed to analyze the cost and time of transactions that store characters in the blockchain. To meet the proposed objective, we designed an application for performing transactions with data inclusion and query on a blockchain, collecting time and cost data. As main conclusions of this work we have: the Ethereum platform proved to be inconstant in relation to the processing time of transactions on the blockchain and the application developed based on blockchain can provide a mechanism to evaluate text-type operations on Ethereum network.',\n",
              "  8: \"Cognitive computing, a revolutionary AI concept emulating human brain's reasoning process, is progressively flourishing in the Industry 4.0 automation. With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of â€œdata islandâ€\\x9d with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. Extensive evaluation and assessment findings demonstrate D2C's effectiveness relative to existing leading designs and models.\",\n",
              "  9: 'How to enable high-performance task offloading and preserve the trust between participants is imperative yet nontrivial to the Cloud-Edge-Device (CED) computing, mainly because the resources are geo-distributed and operated by different parties. Also, the CED participants are highly dynamic and heterogeneous in resource provision and may conflict in interest. This paper proposes BlockChain-empowered CED (BC-CED), a blockchain-empowered collaborative task offloading for CED computing. In BC-CED, blockchain plays a central role in the main functionality of CED, including task offloading, brokerage of resource usage, and incentives. We distinguish the BC-CED from the existing solutions by modifying the blockchain consensus process, enabling the participants to reach an agreement via solving the task offloading problem. For this purpose, we formulate the offloading problem by considering the computation capabilities of candidate nodes and the network performance. BC-CED allows each participant to apply reinforcement learning-based methods to solve this problem and compete for the right of block output by comparing the offloading policy performance and accepting the best policy as the offloading scheme within the next period. We also propose a truthful incentive mechanism to encourage resource contributions in BC-CED and force them to be honest. Extensive tests by implementing our solutions in a commercialized blockchain platform have shown how BC-CED achieves a superior performance in task offloading and blockchain maintece.',\n",

Its successful use in cryptocurrencies has allowed it to explore its capabilities in commercial, industrial, and service systems, backed by the operational alternatives offered by Ethereum Smart Contracts and the cryptographic security of public and private key. These keys are used as a way to make online transactions anonymously, with the guarantee offered by the Blockchain network that they are executed safely. With the above in mind, this concept can be extended to the electoral processes, thus allowing its application in electronic voting systems, especially when the protocols currently used lack the trust factor between the different social actors. This document presents a proof of concept in which Blockchain and other technologies are applied, to allow interaction as an electronic voting system for the election of unique candidates. This has been achieved through the specification of an architecture designed especially for electoral processes, from which it is implemented and a simulation is carried out in order to obtain data that generates value, when evaluating Blockchain technology as an alternative to current voting systems.',\n",
              "  11: \"Reliable identity management and authentication are significant for network security. In recent years, as traditional centralized identity management systems suffer from security and scalability problems, decentralized identity management has received considerable attention in academia and industry. However, with the increasing sharing interaction among each domain, management and authentication of decentralized identity has raised higher requirements for cross-domain trust and faced implementation challenges galore. To solve these problems, we propose BIdM, a decentralized cross- domain identity management system based on blockchain. We design a decentralized identifier (DID) for naming identities based on the consortium blockchain technique. Since the identity subject fully controls the life cycle and ownership of the proposed DID, it can be signed and issued without a central authentication node's intervention. Simultaneously, every node in the system can participate in identity authentication and trust establishment, thereby solving the centralized mechanism's single point of failure problem. To further improve authentication efficiency and protect users' privacy, BIdM introduces a one-way accumulator as an identity data structure, which guarantees the validity of entity identity. We theoretically analyze the feasibility and performance of BIdM and conduct evaluations on a prototype implementation. The experimental results demonstrate that BIdM achieves excellent optimization on cross-domain authentication compared with existing identity management systems.\",\n",

Thanks to the use of next-generation pluggable coherent optics, it is possible to create connectivity services (CSs) across multiple optical transport domains. In this multi-domain CS scenario, cloud operators and transport operators have to work together in the most dynamic way possible. To do so, they need a common place (i.e., a market) where the transport operators may expose their available optical resources and the cloud operators request (e.g., rent) them to be used in order to create end-to-end (E2E) CSs between DCs. Having multiple transport operators exposing their resource information in a common place requires a set of common rules (i.e., how much of the topology to show) to create E2E CSs requested between cloud operators. This paper makes use of the blockchain technology to present a blockchain-based extension for the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to allow each optical transport operator domain to become a peer in a blockchain network. In there, each peer follows the same rules and shares the same exact level of topology information by using a specific abstraction model to map the optical domain resources. This paper uses a set of three different abstraction models to validate their behavior on a blockchain system when managing multiple domain resources and the deployment of CSs across these domains. To do so, an experimental comparison on how the different abstraction models affect the performance of the blockchain system is presented.',\n",

To address this problem, stochastic model-based approaches are often utilized. However, the abstract models in prior work turn out not to be adoptable to consortium blockchains as the consensus of such a blockchain often consists of multiple processes. To address the lack of efficient analysis tools, we propose a queueing network-based method for analyzing consistency properties of consortium blockchain protocols in this article. Our method provides a way to evaluate the performance of the main stages in blockchain consensus. We apply our framework to the Hyperledger Fabric system and recover key properties of the blockchain network. Using our method, we analyze the security properties of the ordering mechanism and the impact of delaying endorsement messages in consortium blockchain protocols. Then an upper bound is derived of the damage an attacker could cause who is capable of delaying the honest players' messages. Based on the proposed method, we employ analytical derivations to investigate both the security and performance features, and corroborate close agreement with measurements on a wide-area network testbed running the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.

We then analyze these architectures along dimensions of semantic modeling support between private and public networks, data connectivity between networks, syntactic interoperability support between networks with heterogeneous codebases, goverce model, and technical features.

Due to the sheer number of involved participants, it is crucial to protect the dataflow integrity in the pipeline. While previous studies have outlined solutions to this matter, the solution for an untrusted data pipeline is still left unexplored, which motivates us to propose SIGNORA. Our proposal combines the concept of a chain of signatures with blockchain receipt to provide dataflow integrity. The chain of signatures provides a non-repudiation guarantee from participants, while the hash of the data and signatures is anchored in the blockchain for a non-tampering guarantee through blockchain receipt. Aside from that, SIGNORA also satisfies essential requirements of running data pipeline processing in an open and untrusted environment, such as (i) providing reliable identity management, (ii) solving the trust and accountability issues through a reputation system, (iii) supporting various devices through multiple cryptographic algorithms (i.e., ECDSA, EdDSA, RSA, and HMAC), and (iv) off-chain processing. Our experiment results show that SIGNORA can provide dataflow integrity provisioning in multiple scenarios of data payload size with reasonable overhead. Furthermore, the cost of smart contract methods has also been analyzed, and several off-chain solutions have been addressed to reduce transaction costs. Finally, the reputation system can adapt to the history of nodesâ€™ activities by increasing their scores when they actively perform honest behavior while reducing their scores when they become inactive. Therefore, SIGNORA can provide a high degree of accountability for participants collaborating in an untrusted environment.',\n",

However, the contradiction between data sharing and privacy preserving is still an obstacle in the IIoT. To this end, in this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and publicly auditable multiparty computation scheme for industrial data sharing and computing, which avoids privacy leakage and computation misbehavior by separating the data ownership, data use, and data verification. Using the blockchain technology, a transparent management platform is provided to recognize and trace the illegal data and computation behavior. Moreover, we integrate the noninteractive zero-knowledge proof in the multiparty interaction mechanism, wherein the verification of data consistency and computation validity is executed publicly on the blockchain. Finally, we implement experiment to evaluate the performance of the computation latency, communication overhead and the influence of encryption parameter, and the numerical results illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of our scheme.',\n",

In this paper, we propose segment blockchain, an approach that segmentises blockchain and enables nodes to only store a copy of one blockchain segment. We use PoW as a membership threshold to limit the number of nodes taken by an Adversary-the Adversary can only gain at most n/2 of nodes in a network of n nodes when it has 50% of the calculation power in the system (the Nakamoto blockchain security threshold). A segment blockchain system fails when an Adversary stores all copies of a segment, because the Adversary can then leave the system, causing a permanent loss of the segment. We theoretically prove that segment blockchain can sustain a (AD/n)m failure probability when the Adversary has no more than AD number of nodes and every segment is stored by m number of nodes. The storage requirement is mostly shrunken compared to the traditional design and therefore making the blockchain more suitable for data-heavy applications.',\n",

Previous studies on the consensus algorithm have the following limitations: 1) no resource consumption analysis was done, 2) performance analysis was not comprehensive in terms of blockchain parameters (e.g., number of orderer nodes, number of fault nodes, batch size, payload size), and 3) practical fault scenarios were not evaluated. In other words, the resource provisioning of consensus algorithms in clouds has not been addressed adequately. As many blockchain services are deployed in the form of blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS), how to provision consensus algorithms becomes a key question to be answered. This study presents a kernel-level analysis for the resource consumption and comprehensive performance evaluations of three major consensus algorithms (i.e., Kafka, Raft, and PBFT). Our experiments reveal that resource consumption differs up to seven times, which demonstrates the importance of proper resource provisioning for BaaS.',\n",

The consensus algorithm is the key to keep consistent among blockchain nodes. In most existing consensus algorithms, the leader node is responsible for proposing new block and communicating with other nodes. The leader node is easy to be the target of malicious attackers. With the increase of the number of nodes, the throughput and scalability of the blockchain system are also unsatisfactory. To address such issues, we propose the AnonymousFox consensus algorithm, which is suitable for the consortium blockchain and private blockchain. First, we design an anonymous leader node sorting algorithm, which hides the identity of the leader node through a variety of encryption algorithms. It periodically changes the ordered leader list to hide the target of malicious attackers. In addition, we design a consensus algorithm based on the anonymous identity of the leader node. Through one-to-many message communication, the amount of messages is greatly reduced. The complexity of the algorithm is  $O(n)$ . It solves the problem of ordered replication of state machines when the leader node is anonymous. We analyze the algorithm, it ensures safety and liveness when the fault nodes are less than one-third of the total. We evaluate the throughput, latency, scalability, resource consumption, exception processing, smart contract, and blockchain network through experiments. The throughput of the proposed algorithm is 49.3% higher than that of the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high performance and scalability.',\n",

FL is an emerging collaborative machine learning technique that trains a model across multiple devices or servers holding private data samples without exchanging their data. The locally trained results are aggregated by a centralized server in a privacy-preserving way. However, there is an assumption where the centralized server is trustworthy, which is impractical. Fortunately, blockchain technology has opened a new era of data exchange among trustless strangers because of its decentralized architecture and cryptography-supported techniques.

Specifically, based on the proposed smart agent, a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving and fair deep learning blockchain-FL framework is designed, where the agent network is consistent with the blockchain network and each smart agent is a participant in the FL task. During the whole training process, both the data and the model are not at the risk of leakage. Findings â€“ A demonstration of the proposed architecture is designed to train a neural network.

To fulfill such a goal, in this article, we design a new smart contract-based blockchain-envisioned authenticated key agreement mechanism in a smart farming environment. The device-to-device (D2D) authentication phase and device-to-gateway (D2G) authentication phase support mutual authentication and key agreement between two Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices and between an IoT device and the gateway node (GWN) in the network, respectively. The blocks are created by the edge servers on the authenticated data of IoT devices received from the GWNs and then sent to the cloud server (CS).

This further reduces the probability of the traffic jams and accidents. However, the insecure (public) communication among the various entities in IoV makes various security threats and attacks that can be launched by passive/active adversaries present in the network. In view of this context, there is a need of an efficient cryptographic primitive which can produce single compact signature. A multi-signature scheme (MSS) empowers a collection of signers to conjointly sign a given message using a single compact signature that can be verified by any verifier. Herein, we put forward a new identity-based multivariate MSS, namely MV-MSS, which is built on top of the intractability of multivariate-quadratic (MQ) problem. The fact is that multivariate public key cryptosystem provides fast, post-quantum safe and efficient primitives, which makes it the front runner candidate among the post-quantum cryptographic candidates. MV-MSS is proven to be secure in the existential unforgeability under chosen-message and chosen identity attack model if solving the MQ problem is NP-hard. We then incorporate the designed MV-MSS in IoV application where the leader (cluster head) selected from a group of vehicles in a dynamic cluster forms the multi-signatures on the messages securely received from its member vehicles. Later, the messages along with their multi-signatures are forwarded to the nearby road-side unit (RSU) of the cluster head, which are then forwarded to a cloud server in the blockchain center maintained by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers network. In this way, the messages and their signatures considered as transactions are put in blocks and added into a public blockchain with the help of consensus algorithm. A comparative study among the proposed MV-MSS and other existing schemes shows that MV-MSS is efficient and secure as compared to other schemes. Finally, a blockchain implementation through simulation study has been performed to show its practical use in IoV application.',\n",

Despite its contribution, the current cloud-based architecture may cause severe data leakage or jeopardize user privacy. Meanwhile, the cloud-based architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party auditor (TPA) and runs in a centralized control manner. However, the TPA may not be a completely trustworthy entity, and a single point of failure might cause the centralized system to collapse. Fortunately, with the advent of blockchain technology, the decentralized storage model has gained popularity. A decentralized storage system successfully eradicates the rule of TPA, solves the problem of a single point of failure, and has many advantages over a centralized control architecture, such as low storage prices and high throughput. This study offers a blockchain-based decentralized distributed storage and sharing scheme that provides end-to-end encryption and fine-grained access control. In our proposed IoTChain model, fine-grained permission is based on attribute-based access control (A-BAC) policy by employing the Ethereum blockchain as an auditable access control layer. Smart contracts are tailored for the IoTChain model, which combines the Ethereum blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS). We used an advanced encryption standard (AES) for encryption and the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for secret key sharing between data owners and users.

To this end, the system rapidly disseminates the block data to all the peers on the blockchain network. The blockchain network is organized with mobile edge cloud (MEC) server and mobile peers in the 5G network. To ensure a scalable and reliable blockchain architecture, the core functionalities of the HLF blockchain are appropriately distributed among the mobile edge cloud and each mobile peer. The MEC server handles core functionalities for the blockchain network, such as block generation and membership management.

The experiments were carried out on a network size of up to 60 nodes and a real energy trading data set from the Western Australian energy market was used. The experiment results indicate that the IBFT-based system has 15x lower latency and nearly 2x throughput compared to existing Proof of Work based P2P-ET solutions. Moreover, the system provides better scalability and success rate than existing Raft based P2P-ET systems: the fail rate of the IBFT-based system only increased by 11% while that of Raft increased by 20% when increasing the number of nodes from 20 to 60. In addition, the proposed unified energy trading model provides lower latency and reduces the number of blockchain transactions compared to the non-unified counterpart.\",\n",

IoT paradigm, information and communication technology, and intelligent computing are assimilated as a single entity for industrial automation, optimization, sharing and security, and scalability. In a view of the security requirement in smart industry data sharing through IoT, this article introduces a blockchain-assisted secure data sharing (BSDS) model. This model is responsible for administering inbound and outbound security in data acquisition and dissemination. The inbound acquisition is first classified using recurrent learning to identify adverse sequences in data dissemination. In the outbound security measure, end-to-end authentication based on the blockchain information of reputation and sequence differentiation is engaged. The blockchain paradigm controls the data gathering and dissemination instances through the classification and integrity verification in both the industry and processing terminals. For this purpose, the functions of the blockchain are riven for data gathering and monitoring in the smart industry whereas integrity and sequence verification is performed by the nonmining blockchain terminal in the processing environment. The integrated security measures are capable of maximizing the response rate by confining false alarm progression, failure rate, and time delay. Statistical analysis shows that the BSDS achieves a 5.67% high response rate and reduces the failure rate by 2.14%. Further, it achieves 3.12%, maximizes response rate by 6.63%, and reduces delay by 11.91%, respectively.',\n",

Nevertheless, the proof-of-work based consensus protocols are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as double-spending. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular, we adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing cyber risks due to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market, which is composed of the infrastructure provider, the blockchain provider, the cyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the infrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the blockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The blockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the service price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the blockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider also purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from the potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts the insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain service. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we model the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the cyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then the users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service. Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a series of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market game.',\n",

As it is effective in crime prevention and accident management and it can also be used as learning data for Traffic Accident Detection technology for Autonomous Vehicles the use of Dashcam is increasing. However, the video data is stored on a memory card or a cloud server, so there is a high possibility of data loss and forgery. Although it is possible to prevent forgery and falsification using distributed storage based on blockchain technology, the authenticity and privacy of the image data stored in the blockchain cannot be guaranteed. In this study, to solve this problem, we propose a multi-signature-based access control method by grouping and storing video data of multiple vehicles based on GPS (Global Positioning System) data. To ensure the privacy of the video data stored in the blockchain, only users uploading video belonging to the relevant GPS can access nearby Dashcam videos. Through these experimental results, it show that Experimental results proposed method can maintain low latency in large-scale request environment to the privacy and reach data management efficiently in a distributed file system. According to our experiments, the dashcam video data distributed storage latency was fast enough, with an average of 25 ms for uploads and less than 15 ms for downloads. The signature generation time is 10ms, and the verification time required for access control is also less than 100 ms, which is the same even if the number of nodes increases, so scalability is not affected. The blockchain transaction processing took about 2 seconds, but it does not affect the V2V network. Also, client registration time does not affect performance.',\n",

Searchable encryption technology can perform keyword searches over encrypted data while protecting their privacy and guaranteeing the integrity of the data by verifying the search results. However, some associated problems are still encountered, such as the low efficiency of verification and uncontrollable query results. Accordingly, this paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Searchable Encryption (PPSE) scheme based on public and private blockchains. First, we store an encrypted index in a private blockchain while outsourcing corresponding encrypted documents to a public blockchain. The encrypted documents are located through the encrypted index. This method can reduce the storage overhead on the blockchains, and improve the efficiency of transaction execution and the security of stored data. Moreover, we adopt a smart contract to introduce a secondary verification access control mechanism and restrict data users' access to the private blockchain through authorization for the purpose of guaranteeing data privacy and the correctness of access control verification. Finally, the security analysis and experimental results indicate that compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme can not only improve the security of encrypted data but also guarantee the efficiency of the query.\",\n",

The TTP-based paradigm is not suitable for all modern networks, e.g., 5G and beyond networks, which are been evolving to support ubiquitous, decentralized, and autonomous services. Driven by the vision of blockchain technologies, there has been a paradigm shift in applications, from TTP-based to decentralized-trust-based. Decentralized applications (DApps) with blockchains promise no trust on authorities, tackling the key challenges of security and privacy problems. A main thrust of blockchain research is to explore frameworks and paradigms for decentralizing applications, fostering a number of new designs ranging from network architectures to business models. Therefore, this paper provides a compact and concise survey on the state-of-the-art research of decentralizing applications with blockchain in the 5G and beyond perspective. We provide four burning 5G and beyond challenges and discuss five aspects of motivation for decentralizing applications with blockchain. Then, we define nine fundamental modules of blockchains and explain the potential influence of these modules on decentralization in depth. We also discuss the interrelation between decentralization and some desired blockchain properties. Particularly, we present the capabilities of blockchain for decentralizing applications through reviewing DApps for 5G and beyond. We clearly distinguish three blockchain paradigms and discuss how developers to make right choices for 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important learned lessons and open issues in applying blockchain for decentralizing applications. Lessons learned and open issues from this survey will facilitate the transformation of centralized applications to DApps.',\n",

Moreover, we analyze well-known sharding protocols including RapidChain, OmniLedger, and Zilliga to validate our model. The key contribution of our paper is to bound the failure probability for one committee and so for each epoch using probability bounds for sums of upper-bounded hypergeometric and binomial distributions.

Fortunately, blockchain technology has recently emerged as a potential rescuer for IoT-based solutions due to its decentralization and enhanced security features. It is usual for smart contracts to arise in handling and processing the generated data when IoT devices are combined with blockchain. However, blockchain and smart contracts need to interact with input data of the same level of trust to guarantee correct applications execution. This implies using oracles to provide trust compatibility between inserted information collected from IoT devices and blockchain and smart contracts. Therefore, this study adopts a methodology that was shaped based on current literature and design and experiments to provide a full narrative of the process of combining two of the most intriguing systems in todayâ€™s world of technology, namely, blockchain and IoT including a very important part of the comprehensive system, viz. blockchain oracle. Moreover, it was found that the literature lacks a complete view of the IoT-blockchain integration process that covers all its important and related aspects. Therefore, this work is an attempt to fill the gap in literature and contribute to the body of knowledge by surveying the literature about existing IoT-blockchain architectures and shed light on the role of blockchain in addressing IoT issues while demonstrating the concept of oracles as well as their functions in addition to the main operating blockchain oracles. Additionally, this work illustrates a CO2 measuring use case where a smart contract is developed and tested as part of two proposed oracle-based designs.

Then, to further maximize the utilities of both blockchain users and blockchain miners, an optimization problem is formulated to determine an optimal strategy which involves a trade-off between the fast transaction confirmation rate required by blockchain users and the transaction fees obtained by blockchain miners. A Stackelberg game is introduced to model the interaction between the blockchain users and miners. Meanwhile, a distributed algorithm is designed to converge this strategy in an iterative manner based on the buyer-seller negotiation. Additionally, double-spending attack and selfish mining attack are analysed to examine their impact on the system performance in terms of confirmation delay and throughput while guaranteeing the high security level.

Once a vaccine has a problem, it will pose a serious threat to the lives of many people. At present, the supervision of vaccine production is very simple. The vaccine production record is completely controlled by the enterprises. Enterprises only submit production records to the supervisory agency for review when the vaccine needs to be sold. Production records are easily forged and modified. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional centralized management. We propose a supervision method for vaccine production based on double-level blockchain. At first, we have designed a double-level blockchain structure. The first level is private data of vaccine prduction enterprise, including production records and corresponding hash. The next level is public data, including production records hash and vaccine information. In this way, we make vaccine enterprise to submit production records in a timely manner without fear of privacy leaks. We avoid enterprise tampering or falsification of production records through the non-tampering features and time stamps of the blockchain. To improve the time efficiency, we propose a consensus mechanism for multi-node cooperate. The primary supervisory node provides sorting services and verifies the correctness of the blockchain replica. The ordinary supervisory node can replace the primary supervisory node when necessary, and help the primary supervisory node recovers data in case of information loss. The review node is responsible for providing complete and correct blockchain copies for other nodes. So we can avoids the problem of waste of time resources in the traditional blockchain system. In addition, in order to avoid the waste of space caused by the redundancy of the blockchain, we propose a vaccine data cutting mechanism. We use the timestamp of the blockchain and the vaccine validity period to determine if the block can be cutted. At the same time, it is also possible to judge whether the block can be cutted based on the information exchange with the vaccination institution. Through these methods, we have realized spatiotemporal efficiency supervision of vaccine production. And for the time being, research work in the field of vaccine production supervision is still very rare. So Our work is ground-breaking.',\n",

Analyzing and understanding those discussions could provide insights about the topics of interest to practitioners, and help the software development and research communities better understand the needs and challenges facing developers as they work in this new domain. Prior studies propose the use of LDA to study the Stack Exchange discussions. However, a simplistic use of LDA would capture the topics in discussions blindly without keeping in mind the variety of the dataset and domain-specific concepts. Specifically, LDA is biased towards larger sized corpora, and LDA-derived topics are not linked to higher level domain-specific concepts. We propose an approach that combines balanced LDA (which ensures that the topics are balanced across a domain) with the reference architecture of a domain to capture and compare the popularity and impact of discussion topics across the Stack Exchange communities. Popularity measures the distribution of interest in discussions, and impact gauges the trend of popularity over time. We made a number of interesting observations, including: (1) Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Corda are the four most commonly-discussed blockchain platforms on the Stack Exchange communities. (2) A broad range of topics are discussed across the various platforms of distinct layers in our derived reference architecture.

The breakdown of the topic impact across the architectural layers is relatively stable over time except for the Hyperledger Fabric platform.

The middleware layer extracts data from the underlying blockchain system and efficiently reorganizes them in databases. To prevent falsified data from being stored in the middleware, a cryptographic fingerprint is calculated based on each constructed database.

The system governs the attestation process that comprises submitting attestation requests, approving them, recording the response of validators, and manage payments. Clients can, thereafter, provide their feedback about the validator/gateway performance in the form of a reputation score.

However, for relevant authorities to be able to identify misbehaving vehicles through their pseudonyms, it is essential that the privacy protection mechanisms only allow for conditional anonymity and not complete anonymity. In this paper, we propose the use of a permissioned consortium blockchain system with smart contract feature to facilitate secure and conditional privacy-preserving vehicular pseudonym issuance and management in a multi-jurisdictional road network. The use of a permissioned consortium blockchain helps mitigate security risks associated with the complexities in interorganizational data handling, such as in the areas of access control, data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The proposed system architecture takes advantage of the predicted wide availability of Roadside Units (RSUs), and the highly viable, flexible and mature Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology for usage in vehicular pseudonymous communications. We successfully carried out a small-scale simulation of the proposed architecture using the Vehicles in Network Simulation (Veins) platform for integrated traffic and network simulation services (SUMO as the traffic simulator and OMNeT++ as the network simulator), and the Hyperledger Fabric platform as the permissioned consortium blockchain system. Simulation and performance analysis results reveal the feasibility of practical deployment of the scheme, and show that the scheme addresses the identified shortfalls of existing works, including the ability to achieve a better balance between connectivity and storage requirements.',\n",

This survey investigates how blockchain technology can be useful in the scope of supporting health actions that can reduce the spread of COVID-19 infections and allow a return to normality. Since the prominent use of blockchains to mitigate COVID-19 consequences are in the area of contact tracing and vaccine/immunity passport support, the survey mainly focuses on these two classes of applications. The aim of the survey is to show that only a proper combination of blockchain technology with advanced cryptographic techniques can guarantee a secure and privacy preserving support to fight COVID-19. In particular, this article first presents these techniques, i.e. zero-knowledge, Diffie Hellman, blind signatures, and proxy re-encryption, then describes how they are used in combination with blockchains to define robust and privacy-preserving solutions.

While Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has been introduced to achieve more advanced ITS, there are still some unsettled issues such as flexibility and fault tolerance. The conventional centralized approach for ITS is vulnerable to the single point of failure, and lack of flexibility due to its dependence on a trusted third party (TTP). The emergence of blockchain technology provides a potential direction to address these problems. However, due to varying vehicle densities, it is challenging to select the best blockchain parameters to satisfy the application requirements. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel blockchain scheme that can use the best parameters in accordance with the vehicle density. The proposed scheme first defines multiple blockchain channels where each channel is optimized for a certain vehicle density level. Then, the system selects the best channel according to the vehicle density, and the application requirements on the transaction throughput and latency.

To achieve blockchain consensus in wireless network, one of the important steps is to broadcast new block using wireless channel. Under wireless network protocols, the block transmitting will be affected significantly. In this work, we focus on the consensus process in blockchain-based wireless local area network (B-WLAN) by investigating the impact of the media access control (MAC) protocol, CSMA/CA. With the randomness of the backoff counter in CSMA/CA, it is possible for latter blocks to catch up or outpace the earlier one, which complicates blockchain forking problem. In view of this, we propose mining strategies to pause mining for reducing the forking probability, and a discard strategy to remove the forking blocks that already exist in CSMA/CA backoff procedure. Based on the proposed strategies, we design Block Access Control (BAC) approaches to effectively schedule block mining and transmitting for improving the performance of B-WLAN. Then, Markov chain models are presented to conduct performance analysis in B-WLAN. The results show that BAC approaches can help the network to achieve a high transaction throughput while improving block utilization and saving computational power.

Most existing blockchain consensus works assume that the time of block propagation among separated nodes during the consensus process is ignorable, i.e., a block always successfully reaches every participating node during a period of time that is far shorter than the mining time. However, when blockchain is used in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the block propagation time is no longer negligible since the dynamic connectivity of the moving nodes in a wireless environment brings opportunistic communication to blockchain consensus. In this article, we study the impact of mobility on block propagation under the single-chain structure in VANET. Specifically, we investigate the dynamics of block propagation from the macroscopic view and derive the closed-form expression of the single-block propagation time. Then, we characterize the blockchain forking as the multiblock competitive propagation. In this way, an approximate result on multiblock propagation time is discussed. An interesting finding is that higher mobility and more moving vehicles can speed up the block propagation. In addition, we also discover that distinct propagation capabilities of moving nodes contribute to the forking reduction in the blockchain consensus.',\n",

This is due to the lack of a scheme that can truthfully reflect the physical world in a real-time and consistent manner. Such an absence hinders further blockchain applications in the physical world, especially for the security-sensitive ones.

Our scheme consists of 1) a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-enabled trusted environment monitoring system built with the Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller that continuously senses the inside of a vaccine box through trusted sensors and generates anti-forgery data, and 2) a consistency protocol to upload the environment status data from the TEE system to blockchain in a truthful, real-time consistent, continuous and fault-tolerant fashion. Our security analysis indicates that no adversary can tamper with the vaccine in any way without being captured. We carry out an experiment to record the internal status of a vaccine shipping box during transportation, and the results indicate that the proposed system incurs an average latency of 84 ms in local sensing and processing followed by an average latency of 130 ms to have the sensed data transmitted to and been available in the blockchain.',\n",

As a case study, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to a multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We first construct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. Then, a scenario-based analysis determines the probability of occurrence of each threat. Finally, a combined analysis is developed to determine which attack outcomes have the highest risk. In the case study of the public permissioned BSMD, the outcomes of the risk analysis highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. The analysis uncovers specific blockchain technology security vulnerabilities in the transportation ecosystem by exposing new attack vectors.\",\n",

(2021) for secure information and reputation data management in large-scale wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, the DBC is a private blockchain deployed on a cloud-fog communication network which is composed of an information blockchain (IBC) storing large amounts of IoT data in the cloud layer and a reputation blockchain (RBC) storing reputation data of the IoT devices in the near-terminal fog layer. The locations of the fog layer nodes are modeled according to a random Poisson point process (PPP) over a given 2-D area to approximate the stochastic property of real-world wireless node deployments. Furthermore, we assume that the number of IoT devices transmitting to the fog nodes also follow a random Poisson distribution. Based on these models, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the storage size, transmission latency, and tampering time of the IoT fog nodes in our DBC architecture. Numerical simulations highlight high storage scalability, low latency, and superior security of the DBC design, and provide insights into the performance gains for different fog node and IoT device densities.',\n",

To address them, we propose a practical blockchain solution to achieve decentralized policy management and evaluation on attribute-based access control (ABAC). By offloading the responsibility of ABAC policy administration and decision making to blockchain nodes, a blockchain-based access control framework, called Policychain, is presented to ensure policy with high availability, autonomy, and traceability. To deliver a solid design, we first present a transaction-oriented policy expression scheme with a well-defined syntax and semantics. The scheme can translate ABAC policies into the blockchain transactions with JavaScript object notation (JSON) syntax and script-based logical expression. We further realize a script-driven policy evaluation by extending blockchain inherent scripting instructions to support attribute acquisition of ABAC entities. Furthermore, we propose a policy lifecycle management scheme from policy creation, renovation, to revocation, in which policies are verified by three validation principles at the transaction level. Finally, we provide sophisticated analysis and experiments to show that our framework is secure and practical for decentralized policy management on ABAC in IoT-ICS.',\n",

These critical aspects pose serious limitations and issues for the industry to provide industrial data integrity, information exchange reliability, provece, and trustworthiness for the overall activities and service delivery prospects.

Such a storage sustainability issue is partially due to minersâ€™ heterogeneous storage costs and usersâ€™ low-intensity fee competition. Motivated by these two observations, we propose a Fee and Transaction Expiration Time (FTET) mechanism to alleviate this issue. Specifically, we model the blockchain operation as a three-stage game. In Stage I, the system designer proposes the storage sustainability mechanism. In Stage II, each user decides whether to propose transactions and the corresponding transaction fees. In Stage III, each miner decides which transactions to include in the block. Although the analysis of the heterogeneous miner interaction is technically challenging, we fully solve it in closed-form motivated by how miners select transactions in practice. The equilibrium analysis reveals that high-storage-cost miners admit transactions with fees above a time-increasing threshold. Under the optimal FTET mechanism, the blockchain system can achieve the storage sustainability without any social welfare loss, comparing with the maximum achievable social welfare without the storage sustainability constraint. Moreover, the optimal FTET mechanism achieves a higher social welfare than the fee mechanism in current practice by selectively rejecting some transactions suffering high delays. Finally, we implement a blockchain prototype to compare the performance of the optimal FTET mechanism with the mining round time adjustment (MRTA) mechanism. The optimal FTET mechanism achieves higher social welfare (94.5% on average) and better storage sustainability. We find that more pending transactions may lead to lower transaction fees.',\n",

(2) The delegate node replicating the blockchain data can lead to privacy information leak. (3) The delegate node is vulnerable to the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To tackle these drawbacks, we consider to minimize the redundant of blockchain to make the IoT devices as the specialized blockchain nodes.

Then, we establish a local blockchain ledger for each IoT domain to enable more IoT devices as blockchain nodes. The local blockchain ledger records the IoT domain entities' attributes, policy files' digests, and access decisions. Meanwhile, we use the channel technology of HLF to realize cross-domain access and use the IBS to filter the legal access requests for each IoT domain to prevent DDoS attacks.

This requirement leads to the conditional participation and verification of participants, thus weakening the decentralization of a blockchain system. Several compression schemes have been proposed to mitigate this storage problem by compressing a blockchain ledger based on redundancy, modular functions, and hash functions. However, these schemes have the limitation of accumulating the compression results to validate the retained blocks. The accumulation gradually reduces the storage volume for the blockchain ledger within the storage volume of nodes with limited resources, thus reducing the verification capability of the nodes. In this paper, a selective compression scheme using a checkpoint-chain is proposed to prevent the accumulation of compression results. The checkpoint-chain is a second blockchain that stores the checkpoints compressing existing blocks through a block Merkle tree. An update process is also proposed to prevent the accumulation of checkpoints by combining them. As numerous blocks can be verified with only a few updated checkpoints, blockchain nodes with limited resources can reduce the storage volume for the blockchain ledger and achieve high verification capabilities. Finally, compared with the existing compression schemes, the proposed scheme can achieve an average reduction in the storage overhead and an average increase in the verification capability of 76.02% and 13.90%, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding performance improvements are 86.14% and 15.44% when the update process is performed, respectively.',\n",

On this basis, we achieve a trustworthy and efficient data auditing mechanism that helps to check data integrity by using both the blockchain technique and bilinear pairing cryptosystem. The blockchain system is used to record the behaviors of entities in both data outsourcing and auditing processes so that the corresponding immutable records can be used to not only ensure the credibility of audit results but also help to monitor unreliable third-party auditors.

Hence, security solutions such as conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) protocols have been proposed. However, CPPA protocols are generally far from being ready for deployment in VANETs, for example due key/certificate management limitations in PKI-based protocols or intractable private key updating in ID-based protocols. Although serveral blockchain-based CPPA (BCPPA) protocols have been proposed to mitigiate these challenges, there still exist some intractabilities such as revoking private key, or frequent interactions, or requiring an idea hardware. Thus, in this paper, we are motivated to propose a novel BCPPA protocol without these existing issues. Specifically, we present a PKI-based solution (using a typical digital signature protocol, such as ECDSA) based on Ethereum (a public blockchain), which is designed to facilitate secure communication in VANETs. In other words, we combine the blockchain technology and a key derivation algorithm to realize an effective certificate management. This reduces the need for participating vehicles to store a large number of private keys. To reduce the verification time cost, our BCPPA suppotrs replacing ECDSA with modified ECDSA for batch verification or directly adopting other PKI-based signatures with batch verification. In addition to introducing the concrete design, we also present the security requirements that our BCPPA protocol can satisfy. We then implement BCPPA in the Ethereum test network (i.e. Rinkeby) and provide simulations using VanetMobiSim and NS-2 to show its feasibility (i.e. milliseconds).',\n",

Specifically, we model the interactions between the protocol designer, users, and miners as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By characterizing the equilibrium of the game, we find that miners neglecting the negative externality in transaction selection cause they are willing to accept insufficient-fee transactions. This leads to the insufficient storage fee issue in the existing protocol (i.e., deployed in Bitcoin and Ethereum). Moreover, our proposed optimal FWT mechanism can motivate users to pay sufficient transaction fees to cover the storage costs and achieve the unconstrained social optimum. Numerical results show that the optimal FWT mechanism guarantees sufficient transaction fees and achieves an average social welfare improvement of 51.43% or more over the existing protocol. Furthermore, the optimal FWT mechanism reduces the average waiting time of low-fee transactions and all transactions by 68.49% and 61.56%, respectively.',\n",

Consequently, infrastructure providers (InPs) desire virtualized networks to share their subleased resources for effective resource management. Nonetheless, security and privacy challenges in the wireless network deter operators from collaborating with one another for resource trading. Lately, blockchain technology has received overwhelming attention for secure resource trading thanks to its security features. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework for blockchain-based resource trading among peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), for autonomous resource slicing in 5G RAN. Specifically, a consortium blockchain network that supports hyperledger smart contract (SC) is deployed to set up secure resource trading among seller and buyer MVNOs.

To achieve a Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) for the formulated game, a dueling deep Q-network (Dueling DQN) scheme is designed to achieve optimal pricing and demand policies for autonomous resource allocation at negotiation interval. Comprehensive simulation results analysis prove that the proposed scheme reduces double spending attacks by 12% in resource trading settings, and maximizes the utilities of players.

In the model, a mining task assigned to a blockchain node (BN) is encoded with a specific encoding function. Thus, the final result, i.e., newly generated block or block verification result, can be decoded even when only some mining outputs returned by BNs are correct, while other outputs are erroneous or discarded due to delays. To be decoded correctly, the number of mining outputs returned prior to decoding must be at least a given decoding threshold. Then, security against malicious BNs and resilience against stragglers can be guaranteed if the number of mining tasks allocated to BNs is not less than the sum of decoding threshold, number of stragglers, and double of the number of malicious BNs. Unlike other IoT blockchains and LCC-based methods showing enhanced throughput but yielding poor security, our model can improve throughput without compromising on security. This is achieved through optimized load allocations when the higher loads (two or more mining tasks) are allocated to the fastest BNs leading to: 1) increased number of mining outputs returned prior to decoding required to meet the decoding threshold and 2) increased number of allocated mining tasks to strengthen security and resilience. To overcome the limitation of our model related to higher loads and, hence, higher mining costs to BNs, we develop a contract-theoretic mechanism that incentivizes each BN to complete its mining task through joint load and transaction fee allocations.',\n",

The integrity and transparency of blockchain are also considered as weak points in terms of privacy. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain system, the secret block-based blockchain (SBBC), to address the problems with the blockchain system in the digital content trading environment. SBBC is composed of off-chain and on-chain network components. Off-chain is the part that allows trading digital content through the authentication phase. The digital content that is traded has a digital fingerprint inserted, so if an illegal leak occurs, the destination can be tracked. In addition, the content is encrypted and traded, and only the rightful user can use the digital content, thus ensuring income for the legitimate content author. Next, the on-chain network is licensed to use digital content, and a verification process using a consensus algorithm is performed. The licensed consumer creates a secret block of their transaction and records it only on their ledger. In a private part, secret block creation ensures privacy and solves the network overload that can occur when uploading digital content to the blockchain. Finally, through the verification and agreement of all blockchain participants, a public block is created and recorded in the ledger to finalize the transaction. Consequently, we propose the SBBC system suitable for digital content trading environments and a safe and reliable system through a consensus algorithm in such environments.',\n",

Recently, decentralized protocols with greater availability appear as well as blockchain-based attestation methods, allowing for proving the existence of information. In combination, these methods promise a secure, decentralized and long-term storage. However, there exist two major problems: (1) the scalability of blockchains limits their storage capacity and (2) various (de)centralized web protocols are in use and could alleviate this problem, but they do not support blockchain-based attestations. In this paper, we extend an approach for blockchain-based attestation with compatibility for multi-protocol storage. Instead of specific protocols or blockchains, the extended approach aims to contribute novel concepts to the discussion on blockchain scalability. It augments the capabilities of existing protocols for applications such as certification or timestamping of digital artifacts. With the use of decentralized protocols such as IPFS, further availability and inherent resilience properties are gained, allowing for applications such as open research repositories and digital registries. We discuss the architecture of the extended approach, a possible implementation in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain with IPFS and Git, and evaluate the time and cost of attestations.',\n",

These fragments can be collected and decoded to obtain the original blockchain only when needed. This reduces the storage requirement of blockchains and makes it possible to incorporate blockchain in wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. However, transmitting such coded fragments consumes nonnegligible resource in wireless networks. Hence, this article studies the storage and transmission tradeoff for coded blockchains, and formulates the coded fragments assignment using an integer linear program (ILP). In particular, a $Q$-hop localization property is proposed to ensure that any device is able to collect sufficient coded fragments for decoding within $Q$-hop neighbors. This article then proposes an efficient heuristic algorithm that is built upon the solution to the relaxed ILP. Apart from these, this article studies regrowing blockchains, where nodes dynamically join and leave the networks, and proposes an algorithm to adjust the coded fragments assignments. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm is close to that of the ILP, and only a small portion of nodes need to recalculate their assignments when using the proposed adjustment algorithm in the regrowing blockchains.',\n",

For block proposing, we employed both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake protocols and examined how participants' incentives and consensus criteria differ according to each one. A major part of this work is to incorporate the graph model in the functionality of the blockchain and its components, while also exploiting its benefits in data analysis by finding relationships between data and extracting their true value. Through this approach, we were able to monitor and visualize changes in blockchain data in various use case scenarios. Lastly, we ran a series of simulated experiments to test the efficiency of the implemented technologies and mechanisms in preventing the most common blockchain attacks such as the 51% Attack, Catastrophic Crashes and Attack from dynamic validator sets. We show how the modelling of the blockchain data as a distributed graph can assist protocols operations, enhance their security, and facilitate the application of analytical methods to the stored information through path-dependent queries.\",\n",

However, the transactions throughput and scalability in the permissioned blockchain are not ideal, despite many optimization efforts in consensus protocol and parallel chain. Existing solutions still reveals some limitations like excessive CPU scheduling, inefficient block broadcast and high latency of initial blocks synchronization when new nodes join blockchain network. Inspired by the emerging RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) network, we propose BoR, an RDMA-based permissioned blockchain framework. By offloading the block transfer transaction into RDMA NICs, it can increase block broadcast speed and reduce block sync delay. We exploit the RDMA primitives to redesign the block synchronization protocol and accelerate DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus process for higher throughput and lower latency in kernel-bypass manner. As demonstrated in our evaluation with different workloads, BoR with lower CPU utilization significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art EoS blockchain.',\n",

Each shard processes a sub-set of transactions, rather than the entire network processing all transactions. This raises security issues for sharding-based blockchain protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to analyze the security of these protocols (e.g., OmniLedger and RapidChain). In particular, this methodology estimates the failure probability of one sharding round taking into consideration the failure probabilities of all shards. To illustrate the effectiveness of the estimated failure probability, we conduct a numerical analysis of our methodology based on a huge number of trials. Finally, we compute confidence intervals to accurately estimate the failure probability and compare our methodology with existing approaches.',\n",

Novice software developers and architects are not experts in every domain, so they should either consult external experts or acquire knowledge themselves. The decision-making process gets more complicated as the number of decision-makers, alternatives, and criteria increases. Hence, a decision model is required to externalize and organize knowledge regarding the blockchain platform selection context. Recently, we designed a decision support system to use such decision models to support decision-makers with their technology selection problems in software production. In this article, we introduce a decision model for the blockchain platform selection problem. The decision model has been evaluated through three real-world case studies at three software-producing organizations. The case-study participants asserted that the approach provides significantly more insight into the blockchain platform selection process, provides a richer prioritized option list than if they had done their research independently, and reduces the time and cost of the decision-making process.',\n",

The existing methods of storing certificates and distributing file content entirely rely on the judgment made by the router, and the forwarding process does not consider the security and legality of the data, at the same time, the traditional peer-to-peer (P2P) forwarding network files cannot be effectively reused, and additional security mechanisms are introduced. It affects the performance of the network itself. To improve the overall network performance, optimize the file forwarding process, and ensure the security of content and the verification of historical information, this paper proposes a method for document content storage and distribution that integrates blockchain technology and Named Data Network (NDN). The advantages of data signature encryption, reverse path forwarding of content, and flexible routing improves the overall performance of the forwarding network. Combined with blockchain decentralization technology, the documents and transaction processes can be stored on the chain to ensure the actual security of the forwarding process. In addition, this paper restricts the forwarding process in the NDN network without making any judgments through smart contract rules to ensure the security of confidential files during the forwarding process and, at the same time, limit the forwarding scope of irrelevant junk files in the private network. Finally, experiments prove that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the networkâ€™s overall performance, optimize the forwarding process, and make rule judgments on the forwarding process of specific files to ensure the security of files.',\n",

The proposed model efficiently manages local traffic information through the local one-day blockchain, reducing the memory overhead of vehicles. As the vehicleâ€™s actual identity and activities in other areas are hidden by using one-time public keys, partial privacy of the vehicle is preserved. According to the activity of the vehicle, the vehicleâ€™s reputation score is updated and stored permanently in the global reputation blockchain.

This module presents a virtualization facility layer to the third novel K-means/Random Forest-based On/Off-Chain Dynamic Service Function Chaining Contract Strategy (KRF-ODSFCS) that dynamically, securely and proactively predicts VNF placements and their chaining order in the context of SFCs w.r.t users' dynamic QoS priority demands. BCOOL exhibits a linear complexity and a strong resilience to failures. Simulation results show that BCOOL outperforms the next best comparable strategies by 80% and 100% reliability and efficiency gains in challenging data congestion environments. This yields to fast, reliable and accurate congestion prediction decisions, ahead of time, and optimizes transaction validation processing time. Globally, the Byzantine resilience, complexity and attack mitigation strategies along with simulation results prove that BCOOL securely predicts the congestion and provides real-time monitoring, fast and accurate SFC deployment decisions while lowering both capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX/OPEX) costs.\",\n",
              "  197: 'The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has achieved remarkable results in recent years. A large number of sensors and machinery are connected, and combined with the Internet, to achieve intelligent management and operation. However, the traditional centralized IoT data management solution inevitably encounters challenges of data trust, security, sustainability, and user privacy is difficult to guarantee. This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data. Finally, analysis and evaluation show that the proposed IoVChain scheme is feasible, safe, and extensible for the secure sharing of IoV data.',\n",
              "  198: \"The optimization problem for scheduling distributed energy resources (DERs) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) integrated with the power grid is important to minimize energy consumption from conventional sources in response to demand. Conventionally this optimization problem is solved in a centralized manner, limiting the size of the problem that can be solved and creating a high communication overhead because all the data is transferred to the central controller. These limitations are addressed by the proposed distributed consensus-based alternating direction method of multiplier (DC-ADMM) optimization algorithm, which decomposes the optimization problem into subproblems with private cost function and constraints. The distribution feeder is partitioned into low coupling subnetworks/regions, which solves the private subproblem locally and exchanges information with the neighboring regions to reach consensus. The relaxation strategy is employed for mixed-integer and coupled constraints introduced in the optimal power flow (OPF) problem by stationary and transportable BESS because DC-ADMM convergence is only guaranteed for strict convex problems. The information exchange and synchronization between subnetworks/regions are vital for distributed optimization. In this work, both of these aspects are addressed by the blockchain. The smart contract deployed on the blockchain network acts as a mediator for secure data exchange and synchronization in distributed computation. The blockchain-based distributed optimization problem's effectiveness is tested for a 0.5-MW laboratory microgrid for one hour ahead and day-ahead for the IEEE 123-bus and EPRI J1 test feeders, and results are compared with a centralized solution.\",\n",
              "  199: 'Service provisioning systems assign users to service providers according to allocation criteria that strike an optimal trade-off between usersâ€™ Quality of Experience (QoE) and the operation cost endured by providers. These systems have been leveraging Smart Contracts (SCs) to add trust and transparency to their criteria. However, deploying fixed allocation criteria in SCs does not necessarily lead to the best performance over time since the blockchain participants join and leave flexibly, and their load varies with time, making the original allocation sub-optimal. Furthermore, updating the criteria manually at every variation in the blockchain jeopardizes the autonomous and independent execution promised by SCs. Thus, we propose a set of light-weight agents for SCs that are capable of optimizing the performance. We also propose using online learning SCs, empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, that leverage the chained data to continuously self-tune its allocation criteria. We show that the proposed learning-assisted method achieves superior performance on the combinatorial multi-stage allocation problem while still being executable in real-time. We also compare the proposed approach with standard heuristics as well as planning methods. Results show a significant performance advantage over heuristics and better adaptability to the dynamic nature of blockchain networks.'},\n",

Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial process. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework. The paper uses supply chain as a use case scenario for describing the proposed framework and presents results on its technical feasibility.', '2169-3536', '', '10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948269', '', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8876654', 'Blockchain,internet of things,cyber-physical systems,logistics,p2p network,smart contract', 'Blockchain,Internet of Things,Monitoring,Supply chains,Industries,Security', 'cryptography,distributed databases,Internet of Things,production engineering computing', 'sensor data,IoT devices,industrial processes,private blockchains,service quality,Industrial internet-of-Things monitoring applications,information generation,industrial monitoring applications,Industrial IoT,IoT sensor values,IIoT', '', '13', '', '52', 'CCBY', '21 Oct 2019', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals'], ['Blockchain-Based Outsourced Storage Schema in Untrusted Environment', 'K.

To ensure the availability of data, DO usually outsources the data replications to multiple CSPs (multi-CSPs) and utilizes a third party metadata management (TPMM) to dominate the metadata of the corresponding replications. However, during the outsourced procedures, DO can hardly confirm the confidence of the TPMM who may take some malicious behaviors to affect the reliability of data. Thus, DO inevitably faces data security issues caused by the over-reliance on the semi-trusted TPMM to manage the metadata of replications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of reliable outsourced data service among multi-CSPs in untrusted environment, that is, how to reliably store and verify the metadata of the data replications in untrusted multi-CSPs environment. To address the problem, we use the novel blockchain technology as a medium to build a trusted outsourced service platform. Moreover, we fully consider the innovative characteristics of blockchain including decentralized architecture, redundancy storage, collective maintece, and tamper resistant to ensure the data cannot be changed maliciously. We first design a blockchain-based outsourced service framework for storing data replications in untrusted environment, which contains three key layers, that is, storage layer, verification layer, and blockchain layer. Then, we devise a novel concept of verification peer (VP) for maintaining metadata stored by a form of blockchain, and each of which holds the entire blockchain locally to prevent metadata from being maliciously tampered with. Finally, based on the proposed model, we introduce a collaborative algorithm invoked by VPs to store and verify the metadata of replications. We present a completed analysis and conduct extensive experiments on multi-CSPs scenario.

This requires the exchange of information between vehicles as each vehicle has very limited experience. Due to the decentralized feature of vehicular environment, an efficient management of collaborative behaviors among the vehicles becomes particularly important. Blockchain has been attracting great interest recently because it provides a way to reach consensus in decentralized systems. However, existing blockchain systems assume high communication capabilities for vehicles, which is difficult to achieve in a decentralized vehicular environment. Existing studies also assume the existence of networking infrastructure, such as roadside units (RSU). In this paper, we propose a scheme to empower blockchain in vehicular environments without depending on the existing networking infrastructure. The proposed scheme uses a distributed clustering approach to select some vehicles as edge nodes, and the edge nodes maintain the blockchain used to record transactions in a decentralized way. The proposed scheme employs a distributed approach that guides vehicle clustering with the consideration of multiple metrics based on a fuzzy logic algorithm. By using the edge nodes, the proposed scheme solves the communication problem of maintaining a blockchain in a totally decentralized vehicular environment. We use computer simulations to clarify the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of communication performance by comparing it with existing baselines.', '2169-3536', '', '10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3036399', 'ROIS NII Open Collaborative Research(grant numbers:2020-20S0502), Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019MS06035), Inner Mongolia Science and Technology Major Project, China, Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project of Zhejiang Province, China(grant numbers:LGG18F020004), JSPS KAKENHI, Japan(grant numbers:20H00592), ', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9250438', 'Vehicular IoT,blockchain technology,edge computing,fuzzy logic', 'Measurement,Fuzzy logic,Computer simulation,Roads,Collaboration,Blockchain,Internet of Things', 'cryptocurrencies,distributed databases,fuzzy logic,Internet of Things,pattern clustering,road vehicles,traffic engineering computing', 'communication performance,fuzzy logic algorithm,distributed clustering approach,driving experiences,fully autonomous driving,vehicular Internet of Things applications,decentralized edges,baselines,totally decentralized vehicular environment,vehicle clustering,edge nodes,networking infrastructure,blockchain systems,decentralized systems,road situations', '', '7', '', '44', 'CCBY', '6 Nov 2020', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals,'], ['A Framework of the Critical Factors for Healthcare Providers to Share Data Securely Using Blockchain', 'A.

Many patients and healthcare organisations are frustrated by the numerous hurdles to obtaining current, real-time patient information. Patients are also frustrated at trying to schedule appointments at health organisations that have outdated contact information. The healthcare sectorâ€™s attention has been drawn to blockchain technology as a part of the solution, especially since this technology has been successfully applied in the ficial sector to improve the security of transactions. The aspect of interoperability is resolved adequately by blockchain technology, because it has the potential to store, manage and share EMRs safely in the healthcare community. Therefore, the technology is having a positive impact on healthcare outcomes for various stakeholders. Interoperability in healthcare eases the exchange of health-related data, such as EMRs, between healthcare entities so that records may be shared and distributed among clinical systems. To handle data in this sector without violating privacy is a challenge, whether in the collection, storage, or analysis. Poor security, which increases data breaches, endangers patients both mentally, socially, and ficially. A lack of data-sharing in the healthcare sector is considered a significant issue worldwide. This research focuses on this gap by investigating the benefits of using blockchain at the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia, providing a detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, and evaluating how blockchain technology improves data-sharing security. This research proposes a framework that identifies the factors supporting data-sharing using blockchain among healthcare organisations. It has three categories: healthcare systems factors, security factors, and blockchain factors. A triangulation technique achieved reliable results in three steps: a literature review, an expert review, and a questionnaire. This gave a comprehensive picture of the research topic, validating and confirming the results. To construct the framework, factors were comprehensively extracted from the literature then analysed, cleared of duplicates, and categorised. As a result, the final framework is confirmed as being based on the literature and expert review, and it is supported by the practitionersâ€™ survey.', '2169-3536', '', '10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3162218', 'Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, ', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9741768', 'Blockchain,healthcare systems,sharing data,privacy,security,Saudi Arabia', 'Medical services,Blockchains,Security,Hospitals,Medical diagnostic imaging,Costs,Europe', 'data privacy,electronic data interchange,electronic health records,health care,medical computing,medical information systems,open systems,security of data', 'data-sharing security,healthcare organisations,healthcare systems factors,security factors,real-time patient information,blockchain technology,ficial sector,healthcare community,health-related data exchange,critical factors,interoperability,EMR,Ministry of Health,Saudi Arabia,triangulation technique', '', '1', '', '105', 'CCBYNCND', '25 Mar 2022', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals'], ['SoK: Network-Level Attacks on the Bitcoin P2P Network', 'F.

Its protocol is today among the most influential for cryptocurrencies and distributed networks. In particular, the P2P layer represents a reference point for all permissionless blockchains, which often implement its solutions in their network layer. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin network protocol lacks a strong security model, leaving it exposed to several threats. Attacks at this level can affect the reliability and trustworthiness of the consensus layer, mining the credibility of the whole system. It is therefore of utmost importance to properly understand and address the security of the Bitcoin P2P protocol. In this paper, we give a comprehensive and detailed overview of known network-level attacks in Bitcoin, as well as the countermeasures that have been implemented in the protocol.

However, existing blockchain systems have a major issue with scalability, which has become one of the main obstacles in technology's adoption in mainstream. There have been several attempts to address this limitation by identifying Blockchain's scalability/performance bottlenecks (e.g. those mainly related to consensus algorithms), and thus proposed different solutions (e.g., new consensus protocols) to address such limitations. Other works applied sharding to tackle the issue. All solutions however have mainly focused on Cryptocurrency applications, and thus addressing the scalability of blockchain systems for general applications remains a concern. This work proposes a scalable blockchain protocol for general applications (i.e., not restricted to Cryptocurrencies). To improve the two major factors affecting transaction scalability, namely throughput and latency, we needed to modify both the blockchain structure as well as the block generation process. ZyConChain, the proposed Blockchain system, introduces three types of blocks that form three separate chains: parentBlock, sideBlock and state block. These blocks are generated based on different consensus algorithms, as each algorithm has specific properties that make it suitable for each type of block. To improve the overall performance, ZyConChain generates sideBlocks (that carry transactions) at a high rate and keep them in a pool. To generate parentBlock, miners, instead of packing transactions into a block as they do in conventional blockchains, pack sideBlocks into a parentBlock. SideBlocks are generated based on an adapted Zyzzyva consensus protocol, with O(\\\\log n) complexity. This has reduced the final consensus complexity per transaction, in comparison to previous work. To enable the protocol to scale out with the increase in the number of nodes, ZyConChain applied sharding technique.

Several kinds of research refer to the use of encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access to data. Selective encryption aims at supporting selective and private access to outsourced data. However, the combination of this approach and indexing techniques cause confidentiality violations.

In this article, we propose a cross-border data sharing platform where a global cloud is built atop multiple security gateways that are set up in different countries. Once an application requests access to data from a particular country or region, the global cloud collects the data stored in local data hubs through that region's security gateway. While transferring the data to the global cloud, the security gateway records this transfer information on a blockchain maintained by the global cloud. When an application reports any misbehavior (e.g., providing wrong data type or incorrect data) against a security gateway, the global cloud verifies the claim by auditing the blockchain and punishes the misbehaving security gateway if the claim is true. In the case of false misbehavior report, the application itself will be punished by the global cloud. Thus, our platform provides an accountable data sharing function using blockchain that relies on a relaxed trust assumption on the data providers. We include five algorithms to handle data access request, data sharing, blockchain transaction, detecting, and punishing misbehaving entities. In the algorithms, we also introduce how the transaction takes place in the platform.

Most current blockchain networks have been deploying the proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, in which the consensus is reached through intensive mining processes. However, this mechanism has several limitations, e.g., energy inefficiency, delay, and vulnerable to security threats. To overcome these problems, a new consensus mechanism has been developed recently, namely proof of stake, which enables to achieve the consensus via proving the stake ownership. This mechanism is expected to become a cutting-edge technology for future blockchain networks. This paper is dedicated to investigating proof-of-stake mechanisms, from fundamental knowledge to advanced proof-of-stake-based protocols along with performance analysis, e.g., energy consumption, delay, and security, as well as their promising applications, particularly in the field of Internet of Vehicles.

To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of â€œblock miningâ€\\x9d by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.', '1558-2183', '', '10.1109/TPDS.2019.2900238', 'WASP/NTU M4082187(grant numbers:4080), Singapore MOE Tier 1(grant numbers:2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17), MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15), Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277), Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041), ', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666727', 'Blockchain,auction,cloud/fog computing,social welfare,pricing,proof of work,game theory', 'Blockchain,Resource management,Protocols,Cryptography,Task analysis,Peer-to-peer computing,Approximation algorithms', 'cloud computing,computational complexity,cryptocurrencies,data mining,distributed databases,electronic commerce,mobile computing,resource allocation,tendering', 'resource allocation,cloud/fog computing,decentralized secure data management platform,multidemand bidding scheme,constant-demand bidding scheme,decentralized data management applications,auction-based market model,block mining,proof-of-work based consensus protocols,public blockchain networks,auction mechanism', '', '129', '', '43', 'IEEE', '13 Mar 2019', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals'], ['Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Federated Learning for IoT Devices', 'Y.

To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customersâ€™ data. Then, manufacturers can predict customersâ€™ requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturersâ€™ activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customersâ€™ privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy (DP) on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique.

Existing DDoS mitigation schemes are facing obstacles due to low flexibility, lack of resources, and high cost. The new emerging technologies, such as blockchain, introduce new opportunities for low-cost, efficient and flexible DDoS attacks mitigation across multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach, called Cochain-SC, which combines two levels of mitigation, intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation. For intra-domain, we propose an effective DDoS mitigation method in the context of software defined networks (SDN), it consists of three schemes: (1) Intra Entropy-based scheme (I-ES) to measure, using sFlow, the randomness of data inside the domain, (2) Intra Bayes-based scheme (I-BS) to classify, based on entropy values, illegitimate flows, and (3) Intra-domain Mitigation (I-DM) scheme to effectively mitigate illegitimate flows inside the domain. For inter-domain, we propose a collaborative DDoS mitigation scheme based on blockchain, it uses the concept of smart contracts (i.e., Ethereum's smart contracts) to facilitate the collaboration among SDN-based domains (i.e., Autonomous System: AS) to mitigate DDoS attacks. For this aim, we design a novel and secure scheme that allows multiple SDN-based domains to securely collaborate and transfer attack information in a decentralized manner. Combining intra- and inter-domain DDoS mitigation, Cochain-SC allows an efficient mitigation along the path of an ongoing attack and an effective mitigation near the origin of the attack. This allows reducing the enormous cost of forwarding packets, across multiple domains, which consist mostly of useless amplified attack traffic. To the best of our knowledge, Cochain-SC is the first scheme that proposes to deal with both intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS attacks mitigation combining SDN, blockchain and smart contract. The implementation of Cochain-SC is deployed on Ethereum official test network Ropsten. Moreover, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach, the experimental results show that Cochain-SC achieves flexibility, efficiency, security, cost effectiveness, and high accuracy in detecting illegitimate flows, making it a promising approach to mitigate DDoS attacks.\", '2169-3536', '', '10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930715', '', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8771111', 'DDoS,entropy,Bayes classifier,SDN,intra-domain mitigation,inter-domain collaboration,blockchain technology,smart contracts', 'Computer crime,Collaboration,Blockchain,Smart contracts,Entropy', 'computer network security,entropy,software defined networking,telecommunication traffic', 'Cochain-SC,illegitimate flows,inter-domain ddos Mitigation scheme,Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks,DDoS mitigation schemes,blockchain-based approach,effective DDoS mitigation method,collaborative DDoS mitigation scheme,smart contract,secure scheme,multiple SDN-based domains,inter-domain DDoS attacks mitigation,intra-domain DDoS mitigation,entropy values,software defined networks,intra entropy-based scheme,intra Bayes-based scheme', '', '69', '', '56', 'CCBY', '24 Jul 2019', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals'], ['BUAV: A blockchain based secure UAV-assisted data acquisition scheme in Internet of Things', 'A.

Therefore, ensuring the privacy and integrity of personal health records and realizing the fine-grained access control are crucial issues when personal health records are shared. As a distributed architecture with decentralized and tamper-proof features, blockchain provides a new way to protect the personal health records sharing system. In this paper, we propose a new personal health records sharing scheme with data integrity verifiable based on blockchain. Aiming at the problems of privacy disclosure, limited keyword search ability and loss of control rights in the process of personal health record sharing, the new scheme uses searchable symmetric encryption and attribute-based encryption techniques to achieve privacy protection, keyword search, and fine-grained access control. Compared with the existing similar schemes, the new scheme allows patients to distribute attribute private key for users, avoiding many security problems caused by the existing of attribute authority in the scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme uses blockchain to manage keys in the scheme, avoiding the single point failure problem of centralized key management.

However, centralized evidence collection and preservation minimizes the reliability of digital evidence. To resolve this severe problem, this paper proposes a novel digital forensic architecture using fast-growing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain technology for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud. In this proposed forensic architecture, the evidence is collected and preserved in the blockchain that is distributed among multiple peers. To protect the system from unauthorized users, Secure Ring Verification based Authentication (SRVA) scheme is proposed. To strengthen the cloud environment, secret keys are generated optimally by using Harmony Search Optimization (HSO) algorithm. All data are encrypted based on the sensitivity level and stored in the cloud server. For encryption, Sensitivity Aware Deep Elliptic Curve Cryptography (SA-DECC) algorithm is presented. For every data stored in the cloud, a block is created in the SDN controller and the history of data is recorded as metadata. In each block, the Merkle hash tree is built by using Secure Hashing Algorithm-3 (SHA-3). Our system allows users to trace their data by deploying Fuzzy based Smart Contracts (FCS). Finally, evidence analysis is enabled by constructing Logical Graph of Evidence (LGoE) collected from the blockchain. Experiments are conducted in an integrated environment of java (for cloud and blockchain) and network simulator-3.26 (for SDN).

While applying blockchain to manage IoT devices and associated big data, the blockchain itself suffers from abuse of decentralization from anonymous users. Specifically, it has been utilized to facilitate black market trades and illegal activities. Ateniese et al. proposed using the chameleon hash (CH) to derive redactable blockchain (EuroS&P), which works by embedding a trapdoor in the basic hash function so that block content can be rewritten without causing major hard forks. In short, the redacted block hash remains unchanged. However, there is lacking intelligent design where any mistakes observed in the chain can be corrected universally and automatically. This creates disincentives to use redactable blockchain (RB) for managing big data or any data-driven business mainly due to ineffective chain redaction. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose the notion of the self-redactable blockchain (SRB) to support intelligent execution of chain redaction. Specifically, we propose the first revocable chameleon hash (RCH) to power RB. It enables an ephemeral trapdoor for finding collision without any co-operation. Periodical expiration is applied to committed hash and an ephemeral trapdoor to prevent any abuses of redaction power. We instantiate how to use our RCH to build SRB as an intelligent trust-layer for IoT. We also give a rigorous analysis as well as comprehensive experiments to validate our proposals.

This study proposes a blockchain and smart contract-based approach to achieve robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for e-commerce fraud detection by facilitating inter-organizational collaboration. The proposed method uses blockchain to secure the privacy of the data. Smart contract deployed inside the network fully automates the system. An ML model is incrementally upgraded from collaborative data provided by the organizations connected to the blockchain. To incentivize the organizations, we have introduced an incentive mechanism that is adaptive to the difficulty level in updating a model. The organizations receive incentives based on the difficulty faced in updating the ML model. A mining criterion has been proposed to mine the block efficiently. And finally, the blockchain network is tested under different difficulty levels and under different volumes of data to test its efficiency. The model achieved 98.93% testing accuracy and 98.22% Fbeta score (recall-biased f measure) over eight incremental updates.

The former indicates the area in which the request for the energy trade is within the operational/physical limitations of the energy trader, while the latter is related to the area where the operation of the trader is economically profitable. Although the formulation provided for the feasibility areas is generic and can be utilized as a tool in various P2P applications, it is tailored in this article for energy storage scheduling. Using the proposed formulation for feasibility areas, the concept of feasibility area estimator is presented. The estimator is, then, integrated with the optimal scheduling model in order to capture operationally and economically viable bids traded in a blockchain system. Through numerical results, the efficacy and validity of the proposed model in this article are evaluated. It is demonstrated that different characteristics can be created for filtering the feasible bids to be utilized for storage scheduling.

However, a lightweight client is hard to verify a newly issued transaction, thus making the zero-confirmation transactions between lightweight clients impossible. In particular, transaction verification needs to verify that each referred output of the transaction is not previously spent. The conventional lightweight client design is unscalable as it can only support such an operation in the complexity of  $O$ ( $N_{T}$ ), where  $N_{T}$  is the total number of transactions in the system. The latest proposals suggest summarizing all the unspent outputs in an ordered Merkle tree. Therefore, a light client can request proof of presence and/or absence of an element in it to prove whether a referred output is previously spent or not, in the complexity of  $O$ (log( $N_{U}$ )), where  $N_{U}$  is the total number of unspent output in the system. However, updating such ordered Merkle tree is slow, thus making the system impracticalâ€”by our evaluation, when a new block is generated in Bitcoin, it takes more than one minute to update the ordered Merkle tree. We propose a practical client, TICK, to solve this problem. TICK uses the AVL hash tree to store all the unspent outputs. The AVL hash tree can be updated in the time of  $O$ ( $M$ *log( $N_{U}$ )), where  $M$  is the number of elements that need to be inserted or removed from the AVL hash tree. By evaluation, when a new block is generated, the AVL hash tree can be updated within 1 s. Similarly, the proof can also be generated in the time of  $O$ (log( $N_{U}$ )). Therefore,  ${\\\\textsf {TICK}}$  is practical and scalable. Benefited by the AVL hash tree, a storage-limited device can efficiently and cryptographically verify transactions. In addition, rather than requiring new miners to download the entire blockchain before mining, TICK allows new miners to download only a small portion of data to start mining. We implement TICK for Bitcoin and provide an experimental evaluation on its performance by using the current Bitcoin blockchain data. Our result shows that the proof for verifying whether an output of a transaction is spent or not is only several kB. The verification is very fastâ€”generating a proof generally takes less than 1 ms and verifying a proof even takes much less time. In addition, to start mining, new miners only need to download several GB data, rather than downloading over 230-GB data.', '2327-4662', '', '10.1109/JIOT.2020.3015476', '', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9163325', 'Blockchain,light client,transaction verification', 'Vegetation,Bitcoin,History,Data mining,Internet of Things', 'blockchains,computational complexity,cryptocurrencies,data mining,transaction processing,tree data structures', 'TICK,bitcoin blockchain data,tiny client,storage-limited device,block headers,zero-confirmation transactions,transaction verification,ordered Merkle tree,lightweight client design,AVL hash tree,data mining', '', '1', '', '30', 'IEEE', '10 Aug 2020', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals'], ['Smart Micro-GaS: A Cognitive Micro Natural Gas Industrial Ecosystem Based on Mixed Blockchain and Edge Computing', 'Y.

Motivated by the distributed data authentication in blockchain, we propose to adopt blockchain to ensure the data integrity in IoT networks. However, the existing blockchain scheme cannot be directly applied to IoT nodes with limited computing and network resources. Hence, we develop a stochastic blockchain scheme to limit the number of cooperative nodes and distribute the load to IoT edge nodes. In our scheme, the IoT data are broadcast by randomly selected cooperative nodes, thereby introducing uncertainty to the attacker and improving the system security level. Finally, we propose a lightweight mining process to make only the IoT edge nodes compete for block generation and share the block with other nodes.

To address these challenging issues, in this article, a lightweight threshold CA for consortium blockchain along with a privacy-preserving LBS protocol in blockchain enforced VSNs is proposed. First, a lightweight threshold CA framework LTCA is proposed by devising a threshold proxy signature, where the proxy signing key is issued by a coalition of threshold number of CAs playing the roles of authorized nodes in the consortium blockchain. Without the intervene of an online CA, each vehicle in the online phase can authenticate its identity by itself each time its blockchain address (i.e., account address) is updated. Then, based on the proposed LTCA, an efficient privacy-preserving LBS protocol PPVC is contrived to protect each vehicleâ€™s conditional identity privacy with a moderate cost.

Blockchain is regarded as a very promising solution to these problems because it possesses characteristics of decentration, non-modifiability and traceability. However, a main challenge is to design an applicable blockchain consensus algorithm which can reach an agreement on credibility of participants automatically, prevent transaction data from tampering, and trace to the source of malicious behaviors. In this paper, an improved Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus scheme is proposed with the underlying technology of blockchain, which is properly to the crowdsourcing service scenarios. Firstly, this PoT consensus selects nodes with high credibility using subjective logic reputation algorithm. Only selected nodes have the chance to generate blocks, participate in verification, and claim crowdsourcing tasks. Secondly, the choice scheme of generate-block nodes is further optimized through the unpredictability of timestamp and digital signature. Moreover, an incentive mechanism based on game theory is designed in this consensus. With this mechanism, candidate nodes prefer to give honest verification results rather than engage in collusion with malicious nodes.

However, since the historical data in the ledger cannot be removed from the Bitcoin system, the openness and the persistent storage of the ledger in the Bitcoin system post new challenges when designing data embedding schemes.

The temporary holding time of the current mined block provides a pool additional time to begin mining the next block early with MBTH attack. In this situation, the winning probability increases for the next block, but the pool may risk losing the mined block. One enhanced method to maintain the winning probability of the held block is to ensure the holding pool sends out the mined block once it receives the mined block message from the other pools with the MBTH-EF attack. The explored MBTH attacks differ from the existing selfish miner and pool attacks. The operations and effects of the MBTH-EF attack are different from stubborn mining strategies and a self-holding attack integrates selfish and stubborn mining attacks. We propose a mining competition solution that does not involve actual hash calculation. It entails using one stochastic target hash value for batch racing simulation to evaluate the holding threshold, holding periods, mining time, mining difficulty, pool sizes, and the rate of fork occurrences according to the operation data of the Bitcoin system. Accordingly, the dynamic time-by-time, block-by-block, and pool-by-pool simulations are adopted to study these attacks. We analyzed MBTH and MBTH-EF attacks as well as evaluated the effects of the win rate on when and how long a block is held. Because the periodic adjustment of mining difficulty reduces the holding effect, we further evaluated how an intermittent MBTH-EF (iMBTH-EF) attack model balance the average mining time and mining difficulty according to the mining difficulty adjustment of a stage.

However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.', '1941-0050', '', '10.1109/TII.2021.3116132', 'National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61373163), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP18K18044,JP21K17736), ', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551794', '5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),cross-domain authentication,federated learning (FL),privacy preservation,smart contract', 'Blockchains,Authentication,Industrial Internet of Things,Training,Data models,Drones,Informatics', '5G mobile communication,autonomous aerial vehicles,blockchains,data privacy,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),telecommunication security', 'blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal federated learning,5G-enabled UAVs,5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles,open nature,privacy leakage,serious losses,machine learning paradigm,data models,raw data,traditional FL framework,centralized aggregation server,unauthorized participants,cross-domain devices,horizontal FL framework,cross-domain UAVs,global model updates,centralized server,cross-domain authentication', '', '53', '', '27', 'IEEE', '28 Sep 2021', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals'], ['An Efficient NIZK Scheme for Privacy-Preserving Transactions Over Account-Model Blockchain', 'S.

However, there are major challenges in scaling up the throughput of such networks. Lightning network and Spider network are alternates that build bidirectional payment channels on top of cryptocurrency networks using smart contracts, to enable fast transactions that bypass the Blockchain. In this article, we study the problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We first propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid model that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a two-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless there is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment processing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of on-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a throughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within the capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed-loop policies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open-loop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature. We investigate this through simulations.', '2325-5870', '', '10.1109/TCNS.2021.3088799', '', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454385', 'Algorithm design and analysis,communication networks,stochastic processes', 'Blockchain,Routing,Bitcoin,Communication networks,Stochastic processes,Smart contracts,Algorithm design and analysis', 'blockchains,closed loop systems,cryptocurrencies,ficial data processing,optimisation,queueing theory,stochastic processes,telecommunication network routing,transaction processing', 'two-sided queue,throughput optimal algorithm,stochastic model,throughput optimal routing,cryptocurrency networks,distributed alternative,lightning network,Spider network,bidirectional payment channels,fast transactions,routing transactions,payment processing network,fluid model,classical queues,centralized ficial transaction networks,blockchain-based payment systems,on-chain rebalancing,capacity region,closed-loop policies,queuing-delay performance,open-loop policies', '', '5', '', '39', 'IEEE', '14 Jun 2021', '', '', 'IEEE', 'IEEE Journals,']]\n",
